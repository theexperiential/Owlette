 * Gate for the admin panel. `minRole` names the tier that may see the wrapped
 * subtree; anyone below it is bounced to /dashboard with an error toast.
 *
 * `'superadmin'` is the platform tier (installers, presets, users, email).
 * `'admin'` is the SITE-SCOPED half (members, tokens, schedules, alerts,
 * webhooks), and since wave 5.1 the global role no longer expresses it — a
 * global `admin` with no membership grants nothing. The gate is now
 * "administers at least one site", which is what those pages actually require:
 * previously such a user reached them, saw an empty site list on every one, and
 * had every write refused server-side.
 *
 * Still coarse by design — WHICH sites they may act on is scoped per page by
 * `useSites`, and again server-side on every write.
