# Exhaustive E2E Coverage Matrix

This matrix is the source of truth for Playwright coverage. A row is complete
when it has an owner spec and either covered coverage targets or an explicit
deferred reason. "API contract owner" means request-level coverage either in
`api-sprint`, Jest, or the new `api-contracts` specs.

A `mobile` entry in the Viewports column means a spec under `e2e/specs/mobile/`
covers that surface. Those specs belong to the `mobile-chromium` project in
`playwright.config.ts` (390x844, `isMobile` + `hasTouch`) and never run at
desktop width. Every one of them ends its assertions with
`assertNoHorizontalOverflow` (`e2e/helpers/mobile.ts`). Note what that helper
does NOT catch: it measures `documentElement`/`body` scroll width, so a
position-fixed surface (dialog, portalled sheet) can overflow the viewport
without failing it — reachability of the controls inside such a surface has to
be asserted directly, via `expectFullyWithinViewport` from the same module.

## API Routes

| API group | Methods | Owner | Required assertions | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| public utility: `/api/version`, `/api/openapi`, `/api/whoami`, `/api/legal/dmca`, `/api/unsubscribe` | GET/POST | `api-contracts/public-utility.spec.ts` | happy path, validation, unauth problem shape where applicable | Covered |
| CLI device-code | POST | `api-contracts/public-utility.spec.ts`, `onboarding/add-cli.spec.ts` | create, missing-field, pending poll, authorized poll | Covered |
| agent auth/device-code/exchange/refresh | POST | existing API tests plus TODO `api-contracts/agent-auth.spec.ts` | validation, expired, unauthorized, refresh | Deferred: happy path depends on Identity Toolkit exchange and stays stubbed in regular CI |
| sites/members/machines/processes/commands/deployments | mixed | existing `api-sprint/*.spec.ts`, `dispatch/*.spec.ts` | auth, validation, representative domain errors | Covered |
| roosts/chunks | mixed | existing `roosts/*.spec.ts`, `api-sprint/*`, TODO `api-contracts/roost-actions.spec.ts` | chunk refs, version addressing, rollback/deploy actions | Deferred: R2 remains Firestore-stubbed in CI |
| v1 project distributions (`/api/sites/{siteId}/project-distributions`) | — | none — was `dispatch/create-deployment-legacy.spec.ts` | — | Removed: the legacy by-URL distribution path was deleted (routes, `project_distributions` rules block, agent `distribute_project` handler). Its owner spec was deleted with it; roost v2 is the only distribution system. |
| admin/platform system presets/installers/email/security | mixed | existing `admin/*.spec.ts`, `admin-presets/presets.spec.ts` | superadmin guard, CRUD, validation | Covered |
| account/passkeys/MFA/settings | mixed | existing `account/*.spec.ts`, `mfa/setup-verify.spec.ts` | user auth, validation, mutation persistence | Covered |
| Hoot APIs | POST | `hoot/hoot.spec.ts`, TODO `api-contracts/hoot.spec.ts` | no-key, message validation, categorize, autonomous/escalation stubs | Deferred: real LLM/tool execution is stubbed; request-contract slice remains needed |

## Shared Components And Dialogs

| Component/dialog | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| PageHeader site picker, account menu, download action (desktop breadcrumb) | existing `access-control/pageheader.spec.ts` | Covered |
| PageHeader mobile nav drawer (site list, page nav, manage-sites entry) | `mobile/sites-dialogs.spec.ts` | Covered |
| Manage-sites dialog + create-site dialog | existing `sites/*.spec.ts`, `mobile/sites-dialogs.spec.ts` | Covered |
| Manage-sites inline edit / delete at mobile widths | `mobile/sites-dialogs.spec.ts` | Covered: taps a row's edit button, asserts the inline editor opens pre-filled, cancels, and asserts the row's delete button plus the header close ✕ sit fully inside the 390x844 viewport by `boundingBox` (`expectFullyWithinViewport`, `e2e/helpers/mobile.ts`). History — this was deferred as an app bug: the dialog header was a no-wrap flex with a `w-64 shrink-0` filter input whose min-content exceeded `max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)]`, inflating the DialogContent grid's single auto column so every row's fixed `64px` actions column landed outside the viewport with no horizontal scroller. Fixed by wrapping the header (`flex-wrap` + `min-w-0 w-full max-w-64` filter), which is desktop-identical at 256px. |
| Account settings tabs: profile, preferences, alerts, hoot/API key, delete account/photo controls | existing `account/*.spec.ts`; TODO `account/full-dialog.spec.ts` | Deferred: destructive delete/photo controls need isolated fixture users/storage stubs |
| Dashboard machine card/process controls/layout/metrics | existing `access-control`, `dispatch`, `time-travel`, `mobile/machine-detail.spec.ts`, `dashboard/process-config-roundtrip.spec.ts`, `dashboard/process-duplicate-names.spec.ts`; TODO `dashboard/full-controls.spec.ts` | Deferred: process dialog, add/delete and the launch-mode toggle are covered end-to-end against the config doc; metrics tabs, screenshots and live view remain the dashboard gap (mobile card expand/collapse + both detail panels are covered) |
| Logs filters/rows/dialogs | `logs/logs.spec.ts` | Covered |
| Hoot sidebar/chat/input/target selector/power toggle | `hoot/hoot.spec.ts` | Covered |
| Hoot multi-machine picker (`MachineTargetPicker`), `@` mention composer (`MentionPopover`), per-turn approval labels | `hoot/hoot.spec.ts`, `a11y/route-smoke.spec.ts` | Covered: tri-state master row and per-machine rows driven as `menuitemcheckbox`, the seeded `targetType:'machines'` chat in `coverageSeed.ts` (two ids, plus an assistant turn whose `metadata.hoot` names only one), and an axe pass with each surface open. The picker's pass is SCOPED to the open menu: a modal Radix menu aria-hides the rest of the document, and /hoot's focusable resize separator then reads as `aria-hidden-focus` for any menu in the app — the unscoped closed-state pass is the row above |
| System preset dialog | `admin-presets/presets.spec.ts` | Covered |
| Deployments uninstall/delete/all dialog options | existing `dispatch/*.spec.ts`; TODO `dispatch/deployment-dialog-options.spec.ts` | Deferred: needs deployment fixture expansion (the mobile row actions menu itself is covered by `mobile/deployments.spec.ts`) |
| Roost upload/version/delete/resync/files/diff dialogs | existing `roosts/*.spec.ts`; TODO `roosts/deep-actions.spec.ts` | Deferred: needs manifest/file-diff fixtures |
| Roost mobile detail sheet (`RoostMobileSheet` — the sub-`lg` replacement for the desktop `<aside>`) | `mobile/roosts.spec.ts` | Covered |

## Cross-Cutting

| Dimension | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Role gates | existing `access-control/route-guards.spec.ts` plus new `/admin/presets` row | Covered |
| Web↔agent process-config contract (`config/{siteId}/machines/{machineId}.processes[]` — wire field names, wire types, duplicate-name gate) | `dashboard/process-config-roundtrip.spec.ts`, `dashboard/process-duplicate-names.spec.ts` | Covered for the web half. Deferred: the desktop-app half (edits made in the local Tauri UI reaching Firestore — the 3.0.0 regression) needs the full-machine harness at `dev/completed/full-machine-e2e/` |
| Talons — nav entry, list rendering, run-history expansion, create round-trip (normalized doc read-back), enable/disable toggle, empty state without layout shift | `talons/talons.spec.ts` | Covered |
| Serious/critical a11y smoke | `a11y/route-smoke.spec.ts` | Covered: every listed route at rest, plus /hoot with the target picker open and with the `@` mention listbox open |
| Visual nonblank smoke | `visual/route-smoke.spec.ts` | Covered |
| Mobile shells where UI differs | `mobile/targeted-shells.spec.ts` (dashboard/logs/hoot/presets), `mobile/sites-dialogs.spec.ts` (PageHeader nav drawer), `mobile/roosts.spec.ts` (detail sheet) | Covered |
| Responsive layout — no horizontal document overflow at 390x844 | `mobile/responsive-acceptance.spec.ts` (route gate, one test per route) plus an `assertNoHorizontalOverflow` call after each interaction in every other `mobile/*.spec.ts`. `targeted-shells.spec.ts` carries the only overflow assertions for `/admin/presets` and for `/logs` with its filter panel open | Covered |
| Touch hit-areas (`pointer-coarse:` ≥ 40px, live only under `hasTouch`) | `mobile/machine-detail.spec.ts` (machine context menu trigger), `mobile/deployments.spec.ts` (row actions trigger) | Covered |
| External services | N/A | Deferred: real R2, email delivery, LLM calls, Python agent execution, and passkey authenticators stay opt-in outside regular CI |
