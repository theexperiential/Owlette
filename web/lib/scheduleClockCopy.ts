/**

 * Process launch windows follow the SITE's clock only when the site opted in
 * (`sites/{siteId}.schedulesFollowSiteTime === true`). The flag is three-state:
 * absent = never asked, `false` = declined, `true` = site time — and absent and
 * `false` both mean the legacy behavior, where every window is evaluated on the
 * machine's own Windows clock. Read it from the Firestore snapshot
 * (`useCurrentSite` / `useSites`), never from `GET /api/sites`, which
 * deliberately collapses absent and `false` into one value.
 *
 * Scheduled REBOOTS stay machine-local in every case (plan decision D2), which
 * is why the machine tooltip splits rather than swaps: the machine clock still
 * governs restarts even after a site opts in.
 *
 * The strings live here, not inline, so the popover, the process dialog and
 * both machine views cannot drift apart, and so the flag-off wording can be
 * pinned byte-for-byte by a unit test.
