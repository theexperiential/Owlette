/**
 * `membership.server.ts` — THE single writer for site membership.
 *
 * Wave 2 of `dev/active/per-site-roles`. Membership is implied today by two legacy
 * fields — `sites/{siteId}.owner` and `users/{uid}.sites[]` — written from eleven
 * places; this module is the only writer allowed from here on.
 *
 * DUAL-WRITE. Every mutation writes BOTH `sites/{siteId}/members/{uid}` and the
 * legacy pair in ONE batch or transaction — a write landing in one shape but not the
 * other is the divergence this wave exists to end. The new document is a shadow until
 * Wave 5, when it becomes authoritative.
 *
 * Three invariants, each a live escalation path before this module (details at each
 * function): `addMember` uses `create()`, never `set()`, so a site admin cannot
 * overwrite the OWNER's row and take the site; `changeRole` cannot reach `'owner'` —
 * ownership moves only through the transactional `transferOwnership` (task 2.2);
 * `removeMember` refuses the owner.
 *
 * SUPERADMINS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT MEMBERS. They reach every site by global role
 * (`resolveSiteAccess` short-circuits before the membership term); writing member rows
 * would leave a demoted superadmin holding a membership nobody granted. The cost is
 * that a superadmin appears in no member list — the members endpoint's problem.
