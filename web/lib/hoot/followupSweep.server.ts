/**
 * The scheduled-follow-up pass of the talons cron sweep.
 *
 * A follow-up is a promise the assistant made to come back to a chat — "check
 * whether that render finished in ten minutes". Firing one starts a normal hoot
 * turn in the SAME chat, on behalf of the user who owns it.
 *
 * Rides `/api/cron/talons` (once a minute) rather than a cron of its own —
 * decision 2026-08-11, `dev/active/talons/plan.md`. The route calls
 * {@link fireDueFollowups} in its own try/catch, so nothing here can take talon
 * dispatch down.
 *
 * ONE query does both jobs: `status == 'scheduled'` ordered by `runAt` asc.
 * Time-due follow-ups sort first, so a bounded scan always sees every one of
 * them; the nearest-future entries that trail them are where an early fire can
 * be found. A follow-up watching a command therefore fires early only while it
 * sits inside {@link FOLLOWUP_SCAN_LIMIT} — past that it still fires at its own
 * `runAt`, which is the whole point of storing one. The alternative (a second
 * indexed query keyed on a `watching` flag) buys precision nobody needs at a
 * handful of live follow-ups per fleet, and starves in its own way.
 *
 * Fire-time authority: site access is re-resolved on every fire, never trusted
 * from scheduling time, so a user removed or demoted in the meantime cannot
 * keep driving tools through a promise they left behind. Re-resolution alone
 * only bounds the fire from above by the OWNER's standing, which is more than a
 * capped turn had — a chat-scoped API key is held to tier 1 yet may still call
 * `schedule_followup`. So the scheduling turn's own ceiling rides on the doc
 * (`maxToolTier`) and the fire takes the lower of the two.
 *
 * Tier 3 always waits for a person (plan decision 9). Unlike a talon this is a
 * forced approval gate, not a tier-2 ceiling: the model may still reach for a
 * tier-3 tool, and the turn parks at approval-requested for the owner to answer
 * when they come back to the chat. `forceTier3Approval` therefore overrides the
 * site's `requireTier3Approval` setting — a site that lets a person auto-run
 * tier 3 while they watch has not agreed to it running while nobody does.
 *
 * A follow-up NEVER supersedes a live turn: someone typing in the chat right
 * now outranks a reminder, so `TurnActiveError` puts the doc back to
 * `scheduled` and the next sweep tries again.
 *
 * Dispatch, not completion: the runner outlives this request, so `fired` means
 * the turn started. Failures after that point are recorded on the turn's own
 * stream doc, not here.
 *
 * Server-side only — never import this in client components.
