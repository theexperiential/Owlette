/**
 * Hoot turn store — the durable record of an in-flight turn at
 * `chats/{chatId}/stream/current`. A turn runs detached from the HTTP request,
 * so its state must survive a dead stream.
 *
 * One doc per chat; a new turn OVERWRITES the previous one and that overwrite
 * IS the supersede — the old runner's guarded writes then no-op on turnId
 * mismatch and watchers see the new turn immediately.
 *
 * The doc is also the AUTHORITATIVE per-turn target record: which machines the
 * turn asked for and which it resolved to, written inside the claim transaction
 * so a record can never exist without them, plus the approvals it ended waiting
 * on. Resuming an approval re-verifies that binding in the same transaction and
 * inherits the bound target, so an approved tier-3 call can never be re-aimed at
 * machines the person who approved it never saw.
 *
 * Every post-acquire write is guarded by a transactional turnId check and
 * never throws into the runner. Messages are JSON-cloned before write because
 * Firestore rejects nested `undefined` (mirrors `web/hooks/useHoot.ts`).
 *
 * Server-side only — never import this in client components.
