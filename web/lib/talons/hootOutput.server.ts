/**
 * The hoot output — a talon-triggered headless assistant turn. A
 * `{ type: 'cortex', directive }` output hands its directive to the assistant
 * with real tools and nobody in the loop, which drives everything below.
 * ("hoot" is user-facing copy only; wire + stored fields stay `cortex`.)
 *
 * Fire-time access re-resolution: the creator's site access is re-resolved on
 * EVERY run (`resolveTalonAuthor`), never trusted from authoring time, so a
 * departed/demoted/soft-deleted author can't keep executing at yesterday's
 * privilege. Terminal by construction, so it carries a
 * {@link TalonDisabledReason} that switches the talon off immediately.
 *
 * Target pre-flight: the run then checks the same things `/api/hoot` checks
 * before it commits a turn — a machine-scoped run that its machine is online
 * and the per-machine hoot kill switch is not engaged
 * ({@link checkMachineGuards}); a site-wide run that at least one machine in the
 * site is online with that same kill switch on ({@link checkSiteGuards}). Every
 * refusal is `skipped`.
 *
 * One fresh chat per run (`chats/talon_{ms}_{runId}`): the turn store holds one
 * lock per chat, so two runs sharing a chat would race for it. The chat is also
 * the artifact the run record points at.
 *
 * Tier ceiling: set explicitly via `maxToolTier`, never by degrading `access` —
 * `startTurn` intersects the two, so a demoted author still drops to tier 1.
 * Default is {@link READ_ONLY_TIER}; `allowActions: true` raises it to
 * {@link UNATTENDED_MAX_TIER} (authoring that flag costs MACHINE_EXEC_COMMAND,
 * same as a `command` output). Tier 3 is capped out in
 * {@link unattendedToolTier} rather than trusted to call sites: tier-3 tools
 * can require in-chat approval, and an unattended turn has nobody to grant it,
 * so the call would hang until declared stale.
 *
 * LLM key: `startTurn` always resolves the CREATOR's own key and takes no
 * override, so it is pre-flighted here (`assertTalonAuthorLlmKey`) before any
 * chat doc or turn lock exists — otherwise a creator who removed their key
 * leaves an empty chat and a claimed lock behind on every firing, and the
 * failure surfaces deep inside a detached runner. The pre-flight never
 * receives the key itself.
 *
 * Dispatch, not completion: the runner outlives the request, so awaiting it
 * would hold the talon run open for a full LLM tool loop.
 *
 * Server-side only — never import this in client components.
