/**
 * deleteSite action core, replacing the client-side `deleteDoc` in
 * `useFirestore.ts:deleteSite`.
 *
 * It CASCADES. Firestore does not delete subcollections with a document, so the
 * original narrow delete left every machine, roost, talon, webhook, setting and —
 * after the per-site-roles migration — every `members/{uid}` row alive under a
 * site id nobody could reach. Ordering is the whole design:
 *
 *   1. audit to the PLATFORM sink, blocking and fail-closed. The site's own
 *      audit_log is a subcollection of the doc below, so a row written there dies
 *      with the evidence of who destroyed it.
 *   2. tombstone the id, so the slug cannot be re-registered mid-cascade.
 *   3. revoke `agent_refresh_tokens` for the site. FIRST among the destructive
 *      steps: a refresh token outlives the site document, so revoking last leaves
 *      a window where the site is gone and an agent can still mint access tokens
 *      against it.
 *   4. clear `users/{uid}.sites[]` for every member — read from the member rows,
 *      so it has to happen BEFORE they are deleted. Skipping it also strands a
 *      dead site id in the client's union, which reports as `membership_fallback`
 *      drift forever and blocks the wave 6.1 strip.
 *   5. recursively delete the site document and every subcollection under it.
 *
 * R2 IS NOT DELETED HERE, and the cascade makes that worse in a way worth stating.
 * The nightly chunk GC (functions/src/chunkGc.ts) enumerates sites with
 * `listDocuments()` SPECIFICALLY because that also returns parents which exist only
 * as a subcollection holder — its own comment says so. Before this cascade a deleted
 * site still had subcollections, so GC kept finding it and could still reclaim its
 * chunks. Once the last subcollection goes, `listDocuments()` stops returning the ref
 * and that R2 prefix becomes unreachable forever.
 *
 * So step 6 records the orphan instead of leaking it silently: `deleted_sites/{siteId}`
 * names the prefixes a future sweep must reclaim. Bulk-deleting R2 inline was the
 * alternative and was rejected — the GC is deliberately fail-closed and still in
 * dry-run, and a destructive path is the wrong place to add an untested bulk delete.
 * This turns "orphaned and undiscoverable" into "orphaned, recorded, reclaimable".
