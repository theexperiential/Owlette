 * `_shared`'s `require*AuthAndScope`, `hoot-utils`' `verifyUserSiteAccess`,
 * `assertUserHasSiteAccess`); they agreed on the happy path and drifted
 * everywhere else. This module owns the DECISION; callers own the RESPONSE —
 * it never builds a NextResponse, picks a status code, or decides whether a
 * capability is required.
 *
 * The wrappers keep their divergent response mappings until Task 1.3 unifies
 * them; that staging is what lets the characterization matrix in
 * `__tests__/lib/authorizationParity.test.ts` stay green across the extraction
 * and go red, deliberately, at the unification.
