/**
 * GET  /api/sites/{siteId}/members — reads `sites/{siteId}/members`, the rows
 *      that actually grant access, and derives each person's role FROM THE ROW.
 *      It used to query `users where sites array-contains {siteId}` and compute
 *      the per-site role from the GLOBAL role, which reported a real site-admin
 *      as a plain member forever.
 *
 * POST /api/sites/{siteId}/members  `{uid | email, role}` — writes the member
 *      row through `addMember`, so the requested role is STORED rather than
 *      derived, and mirrors the id into the legacy `users/{uid}.sites[]` while
 *      that field still exists. `email` is the dashboard's affordance (an admin
 *      knows a colleague's address, not their uid) and resolves through Admin
 *      Auth to the same uid path. Idempotency-Key required.
 *
 * Auth (both verbs): `authorizedSiteHandler({ capability: 'SITE_MEMBER_MANAGE' })`,
 * with api-key permissions `['read','admin']` on GET and `['write','admin']` on
 * POST. Site access is membership — a global `admin` role grants nothing here.
 *
 * api-sprint wave 3 track 3B (users-api / site-members).
