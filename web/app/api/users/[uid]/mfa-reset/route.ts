/**
 * POST /api/users/{uid}/mfa-reset
 *
 * Superadmin recovery for a user locked out of their own account: strip every
 * second factor off ANOTHER user and re-arm mandatory 2FA setup. `/api/mfa/disable`
 * cannot serve this — it acts on the caller's own account and demands live proof
 * of possession, which is exactly what the locked-out user has lost.
 *
 * Steps: (1) delete `users/{uid}/passkeys`, (2) rewrite the factor inventory via
 * `applyMfaFactorChange` + `recountPasskeys` (clears TOTP, secret and backup codes
 * in the same write), (3) revoke trusted devices, (4) emit a mutation audit row.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: credentials before inventory. A crash between them leaves
 * the account locked out — the state it was already in, and a retry finishes the
 * job. Reversed, the account would report zero factors and be signable-into while
 * live WebAuthn credentials survived, so resetting a STOLEN device would look
 * revoked when it was not. `recountPasskeys` (not an explicit zero) for the same
 * reason: the tally is read inside the transaction that writes it, so a failed
 * delete shows up instead of being papered over.
 *
 * Steps 3-4 are best-effort tails — trust records are inert once no factors remain
 * — so a failure there must not fail a reset that already landed.
 *
 * The inventory (`users/{uid}.mfaFactors` + its derived flags) is written ONLY
 * through `lib/mfaFactors.server.ts`; never write those fields here.
 *
 * 200 -> { uid, clearedTotp, deletedPasskeys, trustedDevicesRevoked, enrolled,
 * setupRequired }. 400 malformed uid or soft-deleted target, 403 non-superadmin or
 * self-reset, 404 unknown user, plus the wrapper's auth/scope/rate-limit problems.
