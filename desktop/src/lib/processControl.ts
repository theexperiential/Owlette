/**
 * Stopping a process the way the service expects. Kill and restart differ only in the marker
 * written to `tmp/app_states.json`:
 *
 * - **kill**: terminate, THEN write `KILLED`. The service treats the exit as intentional.
 * - **restart**: write `RESTARTING` on BOTH sides of the kill. The service skips the crash alert,
 *   screenshot and Cortex event, writes a `process_restarted` audit event, and relaunches within
 *   one tick (`owlette_service.py:2598-2630`).
 *
 * The sides are deliberate. `KILLED` asserts the process is gone, so writing it early would lie
 * whenever the kill fails. `RESTARTING` asserts only intent and needs both writes:
 * *before*, because an exit the poller sees before the marker lands is reported as a crash;
 * *after*, because closing takes seconds and every tick in that window writes `RUNNING` over the
 * marker. Each half alone lost a race reproduced on a live agent.
 *
 * Writing early means it can outlive a kill that never happened — {@link stopProcess} undoes that.
 *
 * Both flows are purely local, no cloud command, matching `owlette_gui.py:1182-1303`.
