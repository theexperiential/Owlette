//! System tray icon — native replacement for `agent/src/owlette_tray.py`.
//!
//! Status = the SCM's view of `OwletteService` + `tmp/service_status.json`, read
//! without the JSON mutex. A file older than 120 s means nothing is publishing;
//! the SCM outranks the file in both directions.
//!
//! Deliberate split: what the operator *reads* (tooltip, status rows) is always
//! live and must agree with the window footer's `serviceHealth.deriveFooterState`;
//! what the operator *sees* (icon flash, toasts) keeps the 60 s last-good
//! fallback and the debounces so it does not flap on a torn read. Mixing the two
//! is how the tooltip came to say "connected" while the footer, on the same
//! screen, said "service not running on TEC-A4D".
//!
//! Toasts fire only after 5 s degraded, once per episode, with a 10 s grace
//! after launch.
//!
//! Two deliberate departures from the python tray:
//! * "start on login" manages the `{userstartup}` shortcut
//!   ([`crate::startup_link`]) rather than the service start type — no UAC
//!   prompt, and it cannot leave the machine unsupervised.
//! * "restart service" leaves this app running; single-instance means the
//!   service's post-restart launch folds back into this process.
//!
//! Every menu action runs on its own thread: menu events arrive on the main
//! thread and both the tray and window setters marshal back to it, so inline
//! work would block the event loop for the length of an SCM call or UAC prompt.
