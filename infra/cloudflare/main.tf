# owlette.app failover load balancer.
#
# Topology: one health monitor hitting /api/health on each origin, two single-
# origin pools (railway primary, vercel standby), and a load balancer on
# owlette.app that cascades — Railway first, Vercel only when Railway's health
# check fails. steering_policy = "off" means "use default_pool_ids in order",
# which is exactly failover.
#
# Each origin sends its own Host header, and Cloudflare uses an origin's header
# override for that origin's health checks too (it beats the monitor's). Railway
# serves owlette.app. Vercel is reached as vercel-origin.owlette.app, a DNS-only
# name it holds a certificate for: Vercel renews certificates over HTTP-01, and
# for owlette.app itself those challenges would land on Railway. The web app
# builds outbound links from NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL (lib/publicOrigin.server.ts),
# never the Host header, so the alias doesn't leak to users.
#
# Provider auth + version pin live in versions.tf. The monitor + pools are
# account-scoped; the load balancer is zone-scoped.
