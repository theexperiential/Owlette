owlette is a cloud-connected system for monitoring, managing, and deploying software across fleets of Windows machines — from anywhere. a lightweight Python agent runs on each machine as a Windows service, reporting metrics and executing commands. a modern web dashboard gives you real-time visibility and control over your entire fleet, backed by Firebase and Cloud Firestore.

built for teams running **digital signage**, **media servers**, **kiosks**, **TouchDesigner installations**, and any Windows application that needs to stay running.

## features

**real-time monitoring**
live CPU, memory, disk, GPU, and network metrics. process health tracking with crash detection. remote screenshots and live view. historical metrics with sparkline charts.

**remote deployment**
push software silently to any number of machines. supports NSIS, InnoSetup, MSI, and custom installers. save deployment templates, track progress in real-time, and cancel mid-install.

**cortex ai**
LLM-powered fleet management with natural language. AI executes commands on agents via tool-calling across 3 tiers — from read-only diagnostics to privileged operations. screenshot analysis, autonomous crash investigation, and multi-provider support (Anthropic + OpenAI).

**multi-site management**
organize machines by location, department, or project. three-tier role-based access control (member / admin / superadmin) with site-level permissions. multi-user accounts, per-site admin delegation, and platform-wide administrator roles.

**roost — project distribution**
drag a project folder onto the dashboard and it syncs to your fleet. files are split into 4 MiB content-addressed chunks, hashed in the browser, and uploaded once — re-deploys and machines that already hold a chunk skip it entirely. every deploy is an immutable version you can roll back to in one click, and agents verify every chunk by SHA-256 before assembling files atomically into an allowlisted destination.

roost is the only distribution system — the legacy by-URL path (point the fleet at a hosted ZIP and let the agent download and extract it) has been removed.

**alerts & notifications**
configurable threshold alerts for system metrics. email notifications with branded templates. webhook integrations for external platforms. activity logging across your entire fleet.

## architecture

control and state flow through Cloud Firestore — there is no direct connection between agents and the dashboard. Firestore acts as the message bus, with Next.js API routes handling authenticated control actions.

bulk file bytes do **not** go through Firestore. roost chunks and version bodies live in object storage (Cloudflare R2); browsers and agents read and write them directly using short-lived, single-object signed URLs minted by the API.

```
agents                    cloud                     dashboard
+--------------+     +----------------+     +-----------------+
|  machine a   | --> |                | <-- |                 |
|  machine b   | --> |   Firestore    | --> |  Next.js web    |
|  machine c   | <-- |                |     |  application    |
+--------------+     +----------------+     +-----------------+
                            |
                     +----------------+
                     | Firebase Auth  |
                     +----------------+
```

- **agent** — Python Windows service. monitors processes every 10s, sends heartbeats every 30s, reports metrics every 60s, executes commands, works offline.
- **dashboard** — Next.js 16 web app. real-time Firestore listeners, 63+ API endpoints, OpenAPI documentation.
- **firestore** — real-time NoSQL database. state sync, command relay, and roost version pointers.
- **object storage** — Cloudflare R2. content-addressed roost chunks and version bodies under a per-site prefix, reachable only through signed URLs.
- **cortex ai** — LLM chat with tool-calling capabilities relayed through Firestore to agents.

## quick start

For a new maintainer cloning this repo, start with the [maintainer quickstart](docs/maintainer-quickstart.md).

### hosted (fastest)

1. create an account at [owlette.app](https://owlette.app)
2. create a **site** to organize your machines
3. download the agent installer from the dashboard
4. run the installer on your target Windows machine
5. a **3-word pairing phrase** appears — authorize it from the dashboard or your phone
6. your machine appears in the dashboard within 30 seconds

### self-host

**agent (Windows service):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theexperiential/owlette.git
cd owlette/agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src && python configure_site.py       # pair this machine with a site
python owlette_service.py install && python owlette_service.py start
```

**desktop app (tray + configuration window):**
```bash
cd owlette/desktop
npm install
npm run tauri dev                        # or: npx tauri build --no-bundle
```

**web dashboard:**
```bash
cd owlette/web
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local               # configure Firebase credentials
npm run dev                               # http://localhost:3000
```
