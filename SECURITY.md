### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:

- Authorized concerning any applicable anti-hacking laws
- Authorized concerning any relevant anti-circumvention laws
- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms of Service that would interfere with conducting security research

We will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement for accidental, good-faith violations of this policy.

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Account Security

- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account
- Use a strong, unique password
- Keep your backup codes in a secure location
- Review connected machines regularly

### Agent Security

- Only install the Owlette agent on machines you own or have authorization to manage
- Keep the agent updated to the latest version
- Protect the machine where the agent is installed with standard security practices
- Revoke machine tokens immediately if a machine is compromised

### API Tokens

- Never share your API tokens
- Rotate tokens periodically
- Use the minimum required permissions
- Revoke tokens that are no longer needed

## Security Features

Owlette implements the following security measures:

- **Encryption in Transit**: All communications use TLS/HTTPS
- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based 2FA with backup codes
- **Token Security**: Short-lived access tokens with encrypted refresh tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant actions are logged
