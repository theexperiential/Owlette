"""Generate per-episode assembly sheets + Resolve build manifests.

For each episode: parse the script's beats (via voiceover/generate.py's own
parser so the beat model can't drift), ffprobe each rendered MP3 and every
footage file, and emit

  * `assembly/NN-slug.md`            — the human sheet (per-beat durations,
                                       cumulative narration timecodes, footage)
  * `assembly/manifests/NN-slug.json` — the machine sheet consumed by
                                       `resolve/build_episode.py`, which builds
                                       the episode timeline inside DaVinci
                                       Resolve (free edition).

The JSON manifest carries absolute paths, so it is written for the machine that
generated it. It is a build artifact: regenerate after a re-voice or a re-capture
rather than hand-editing it.

Usage
-----
    python gen-assembly.py
    python gen-assembly.py --media-root c:\\Users\\me\\Documents\\Git\\Owlette

`--media-root` (or `$OWLETTE_MEDIA_ROOT`) is where the *build outputs* live —
`voiceover/out/` MP3s and `footage/` takes. Both are gitignored, so a
git worktree has neither; point this at the main checkout when running from one.
Scripts and the emitted sheets always resolve against this file's own tree.
