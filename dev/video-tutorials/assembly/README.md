# assembly sheets

One sheet per episode: every beat's rendered MP3 length and its cumulative
narration timecode, plus where the footage lives. Regenerate after any
re-voice with `python gen-assembly.py` from this directory (reads the scripts
and rendered audio; makes no API calls).

Each sheet has a machine-readable twin in [`manifests/`](manifests/) that
[`resolve/build_episode.py`](resolve/README.md) turns into a built Resolve
timeline — footage on V1, per-beat narration on A1, a marker per beat carrying
its SCREEN direction.
