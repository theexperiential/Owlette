build_episode.py - pre-build one owlette tutorial episode inside DaVinci Resolve.

Run this from inside Resolve: Workspace -> Scripts -> build_episode.
(The free edition only runs scripts from that menu; see README.md for install.)

What it builds, from `assembly/manifests/NN-slug.json`:
  * a project named "owlette tutorials" (created once, re-used after that)
  * a media-pool bin per episode, holding that episode's footage + beat MP3s
  * a timeline "NN-slug v1" (v2, v3, ... on every re-run - nothing is overwritten)
  * scene footage on V1
  * every beat's narration MP3 on A1 at its cumulative start
  * one marker per beat carrying the beat id, title and its **SCREEN:** direction

The human work starts where it should: zooms, callouts, and pacing.

Verified against the scripting README that ships with DaVinci Resolve 19.0.1
("Last Updated: 16 July 2024"), at
%PROGRAMDATA%\\Blackmagic Design\\DaVinci Resolve\\Support\\Developer\\Scripting\\README.txt

UNTESTED IN-APP. See README.md "first run" for the specific calls to watch.
