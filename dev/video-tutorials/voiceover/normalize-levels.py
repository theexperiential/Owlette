normalize-levels.py - match perceived loudness ACROSS episodes without
disturbing the balance WITHIN one.

Each episode is a single continuous take (render-continuous.py), so its beats
already share a voice, a noise floor and a level relationship. Normalising each
BEAT on its own would throw that away: a deliberately quieter line would be
lifted to match a louder one and the episode would sound like separate takes
again - the exact problem the continuous render fixed.

So loudness is measured ONCE per episode and a SINGLE gain is applied to all of
its beats. Relative dynamics inside the episode are untouched; only the
episode-to-episode offset moves.

The target is not a delivery level, it is the MEDIAN of the episodes' own
current loudness - the level the majority of the series already sits at. That
choice minimises how many files are touched (an episode already at the median
is left bit-for-bit alone) and survives outliers in either direction: a
freshly re-split episode measuring loud, or an accidentally double-gained one
measuring quiet, both get corrected toward the series instead of dragging the
series toward themselves. Normalising up to a delivery level like -16 LUFS is
still not possible here without compression - the raw true peaks sit near
-1 dBTP - so any BOOST is capped so the true peak never exceeds -1 dBTP. The
final export sets delivery level anyway.

IDEMPOTENCE. The gain for an episode is measured against its CURRENT BEATS,
concatenated. An episode already at the target computes ~0 and is skipped; a
freshly re-split episode (raw, un-gained beats) computes the full correction.
Running this script twice is therefore safe - the second run is a no-op - and
a re-split episode heals on the next run without any bookkeeping. Gains inside
SKIP_DB of zero are left alone: they are measurement noise, and a 192k
re-encode generation costs more than 0.2 dB of match buys.

(The original scheme - target = the quietest take, attenuation only - assumed
a fresh, never-normalized corpus and measured the untouched take rather than
the beats. That pair of choices is what made the script non-idempotent: the
measurement never saw what had been applied, so a second run stacked the same
gain again. ep07 was double-gained exactly that way.)
