# episode 2 — day zero: sign up, 2fa, and your first site

> After this you can create an owlette account, get through mandatory two-factor with a passkey or an authenticator app, keep recovery material you can actually use, and stand up your first site with the right clock on it.

## [b01] cold open
**SCREEN:** clean browser on the owlette.app sign-up page, held — where a new account actually begins.
**NOTE:** no capture fixture exists for this episode. `seedScreenshotFixtures` has no scenario for the auth pages or a zero-site dashboard (`web/e2e/screenshots/fixtures.ts` — the union runs `dashboard-mixed-states` … `display-storyboard-frame-3`), so every beat here needs a fresh emulator account: register → enroll → create site. Build one before capture; `scenario: null` until then.
**VOICEOVER:**
[warm] before owlette can look after your machines, it makes sure your account
is looked after first. two-factor is built into setup — no nag screen, no skip
button. a few minutes, done for good. the whole first day: account, second
factor, backup codes, and your first site.

## [b02] signing up
**SCREEN:** `/register` — the "create an account" card. Show "continue with Google" at the top, then click into the email field so the rest unfolds (first/last name, password with its "8+ characters with at least 2 of..." hint, confirm, terms checkbox, the bot-check widget), then "create account". Land on `/setup-2fa`.
**VOICEOVER:**
start at the sign-up page. quickest way in is continue with google — one popup,
no password to invent. prefer your own? click the email field and the rest
unfolds: your name, a password of eight characters or more, and the terms box.
either way, you land on setup — not the dashboard.

## [b03] passkey or authenticator
**SCREEN:** `/setup-2fa`, the "choose your second factor" step — the passkey card (fingerprint icon, "recommended" pill) above the authenticator-app card (phone icon). Hover each so the descriptions are readable.
**VOICEOVER:**
now pick your second factor. a passkey uses what your device already has —
windows hello, touch id, a security key, your password manager. an authenticator
app is the classic six-digit code: scan the qr, or paste the manual code into a
desktop app. pick one now — you can add the other later from account settings.

## [b04] enroll it, and see what sign-in becomes
**SCREEN:** click the passkey card → "create passkey" → the windows hello prompt → "passkey added". Then sign out, land on `/login`, click "continue with passkey", one prompt, straight into the dashboard — no code screen in between.
**NOTE:** the sign-out / sign-back-in half is a SEPARATE take, filmed after b05's codes are claimed — leaving the "passkey added" screen is one-way, and b05 shoots from it.
**VOICEOVER:**
let's take the passkey. click create passkey, and your device asks for its usual
unlock — fingerprint, face, or pin. that unlock is the proof, so there's no code
to type. [reassuring] and it's your whole sign-in from then on: continue with
passkey, one prompt, and you clear who you are and your second factor together.

## [b05] backup codes
**SCREEN:** on the "passkey added" screen, click "get backup codes" — the button flips to "waiting for your device..." and the device prompts a second time. Then the backup step: the ten codes in a mono grid, the red "these codes will only be shown once!" line, "copy all codes", then "continue to dashboard".
**NOTE:** the passkey path needs that extra step-up before any codes render (`web/app/setup-2fa/page.tsx:589-598`). The sibling button on that screen is "skip for now" (`:602-610`) — do not click it on camera; it exits to the dashboard with no codes issued.
**VOICEOVER:**
then owlette hands you ten backup codes. we only store the hashes, so this is the
one time you will ever see them — copy them into your password manager now. you
can mint a fresh set later, but that asks you to prove a factor first, which is
exactly the thing you won't have on the day you need these.

## [b06] trust this device
**SCREEN:** a sign-in on the authenticator path — `/verify-2fa`, the six-digit field, and the "trust this device for 30 days" checkbox being ticked before "verify".
**VOICEOVER:**
if you went the authenticator route, the code screen carries a checkbox: trust
this device for thirty days. tick it on the machine you actually work from and
owlette stops asking for a code there for a month. signing out doesn't clear it —
turning two-factor off does, and so does an admin reset.

## [b07] your first site
**SCREEN:** the dashboard for a brand-new account — the "getting started" card with "step 1: create your first site". Click it → the create dialog: site name ("NYC Office"), the auto-generated site ID with its green available check, the "site timezone" row the dialog fills from the browser ("change timezone" underneath it), then "create site". The card re-renders into the download/install steps.
**NOTE:** needs the zero-site account from b01's note — this empty state only renders when the user has no sites at all.
**VOICEOVER:**
first dashboard, and it's empty on purpose — step one is a site. a site is just a
place: an office, a studio, a production floor. machines live inside it, so give
it the name you'd say out loud. owlette generates the id for you — change it if
you like — then create the site.

## [b08] the site's clock
**SCREEN:** the header site switcher → "manage sites" → the new row, whose timezone column already reads the zone b07's dialog detected → the pencil "edit site" → the timezone picker, held open. Nothing is changed on camera: the beat is where the clock lives afterwards, not a correction.
**VOICEOVER:**
that clock is already set — the create dialog read it from your browser and
started the site on it. right if you made the site where the machines live,
wrong the moment they're somewhere else. change it here: site switcher, manage
sites, then the pencil. new sites follow the site clock, so a nine a.m. window is
nine at the site on every machine — restarts still go by the machine's own clock.

## [b09] locked out, and what's next
**SCREEN:** the OPERATOR'S user-management view (framed as theirs, not the viewer's — superadmin is an internal role, never presented as a public feature): the row menu open with "reset 2FA..." highlighted, then the confirm dialog. Cut back to the getting-started card, now showing "step 1: download owlette agent".
**VOICEOVER:**
last thing — locked out. a backup code gets you straight back in. lost those too?
whoever operates your owlette can reset two-factor from their side — this is what
it looks like for them. it strips every factor, revokes your trusted devices, and
drops you back on setup at your next sign-in. [warm] account done. next up,
getting owlette onto a machine and pairing it with this site.
