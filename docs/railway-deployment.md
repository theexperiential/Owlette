## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Verify Local Build

Before deploying, ensure the application builds successfully locally:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run build
```

If the build fails, fix any TypeScript or build errors before proceeding.

### 2. Verify Railway Configuration

The repository includes a pre-configured [web/railway.toml](../web/railway.toml) file:

```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
buildCommand = "npm install && npm run build"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
```

This configuration:
- Uses Nixpacks builder (Railway's automatic build system)
- Installs dependencies and builds Next.js app
- Starts production server on port 3000
- Restarts service automatically on failure (up to 10 retries)

### 3. Gather Firebase Configuration

You'll need these 6 environment variables from your Firebase project:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
3. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
5. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
6. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

**Where to find them:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your Owlette project
3. Click Settings (gear icon) → Project Settings
4. Scroll to "Your apps" section
5. Select your web app or click "Add app" if none exists
6. Copy the config values from the Firebase SDK snippet

## Railway Project Setup

### Step 1: Create Railway Account

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended for easy repo linking)
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Create New Project

1. Click "New Project" in Railway dashboard
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
4. Select the `Owlette` repository

### Step 3: Configure Deployment Settings

1. **Root Directory**: Set to `web` (since Owlette is a monorepo)
   - Click on your service
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Find "Root Directory" field
   - Enter: `web`

2. **Branch Configuration**: Set deployment branch
   - In "Settings" → "Source"
   - Select branch: `main` (or your production branch)
   - Enable "Auto-deploy on push" (optional but recommended)

3. **Service Name**: Rename for clarity
   - In "Settings" → "Service Name"
   - Change to: `owlette-web-dashboard`

---

## Environment Configuration

### Step 1: Add Firebase Variables

In the Railway dashboard:

1. Click on your service
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Click "New Variable" and add each of the following:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

**Important Notes:**
- Copy values exactly as they appear in Firebase Console
- Do NOT include quotes around the values
- The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required for client-side access in Next.js
- `NODE_ENV=production` is already set in `railway.toml`

### Step 2: Verify Variables

After adding all variables:

1. Click "Show All" to see all environment variables
2. Verify all 6 Firebase variables are present
3. Verify `NODE_ENV=production` exists (auto-added from railway.toml)

---

## First Deployment

### Trigger Deployment

Railway will automatically deploy after environment variables are configured:

**Automatic Trigger:**
- Railway detects changes and starts deployment automatically

**Manual Trigger:**
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Deploy" button
3. Select the branch to deploy

### Monitor Build Process

1. Click on the in-progress deployment
2. View real-time build logs
3. Look for these key milestones:
   - `Installing dependencies...` (npm install)
   - `Building Next.js application...` (npm run build)
   - `Starting production server...` (npm start)
   - `✓ Service deployed successfully`

**Expected Build Time:** 2-5 minutes

### Common Build Issues

**Build fails with "Missing environment variable"**
- Solution: Verify all 6 Firebase variables are set correctly
- The app validates environment variables at startup (see [web/lib/validateEnv.ts](../web/lib/validateEnv.ts))

**Build fails with TypeScript errors**
- Solution: Run `npm run build` locally first and fix errors
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled - all type errors must be resolved

**Build timeout**
- Solution: Check build logs for stuck processes
- Verify `package-lock.json` is committed (ensures consistent dependencies)

### Verify Deployment Success

After successful build:

1. Railway provides a deployment URL (e.g., `owlette-web-dashboard-production.up.railway.app`)
2. Click the URL to open your deployed dashboard
3. Verify the login page loads correctly
4. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)

---

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### Step 1: Update Firebase Authorized Domains

Firebase requires whitelisting domains for authentication:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to: **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized Domains**
4. Click "Add domain"
5. Add your Railway domain (e.g., `owlette-web-dashboard-production.up.railway.app`)
6. Click "Add"

**Without this step:** Users cannot log in - Firebase will reject authentication requests.

### Step 2: Test Authentication

1. Open your Railway deployment URL
2. Try to register a new user account
3. Verify email/password registration works
4. Test login with the new account
5. Verify redirect to dashboard after login

### Step 3: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain:

1. In Railway dashboard, go to "Settings" → "Networking"
2. Click "Add Custom Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `owlette.yourdomain.com`)
4. Railway provides DNS instructions:
   - Add CNAME record pointing to Railway
   - Or add A record with provided IP
5. Wait for DNS propagation (5-60 minutes)
6. Railway automatically provisions SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)

**After adding custom domain:**
- Add custom domain to Firebase Authorized Domains (repeat Step 1)
- Update any hardcoded URLs in your app (if any)

### Step 4: Set Up Health Checks (Optional)

Railway automatically detects Next.js health:

- Default: Checks port 3000 for HTTP response
- No additional configuration needed
- To customize, add health check endpoint in Next.js

---

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed

**Check build logs:**
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click failed deployment
3. Read logs from bottom up (newest first)

**Common causes:**
- Missing environment variables
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Dependency installation failures
- Build timeout (large dependencies)

### Application Crashes After Deployment

**Symptoms:**
- Deployment succeeds but service restarts repeatedly
- "Service Unavailable" or 502 errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Check runtime logs:**
   ```
   Railway Dashboard → Deployments → [Latest] → View Logs
   ```

2. **Common issues:**
   - Environment variables not loaded: Verify in "Variables" tab
   - Port binding issue: Railway auto-injects `PORT` variable (Next.js uses 3000 by default)
   - Firebase initialization error: Check console logs for Firebase errors

3. **Verify environment validation:**
   - Look for: `ERROR: Missing required environment variables`
   - App validates env vars at startup in [web/lib/validateEnv.ts](../web/lib/validateEnv.ts)
   - In production, missing vars cause immediate crash (by design)

### Firebase Authentication Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Login fails with "auth/unauthorized-domain"
- Redirect errors after login

**Solution:**
1. Verify Railway domain is in Firebase Authorized Domains
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Check browser console for detailed Firebase errors
4. Verify Firebase config variables are correct

### Slow Performance

**Common causes:**
- Cold starts (Railway free tier spins down after inactivity)
- Large bundle size
- Firestore queries not optimized

**Solutions:**
1. **Upgrade Railway plan** (Pro tier has no cold starts)
2. **Optimize bundle:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Check .next/static output size
   ```
3. **Add caching headers** in [next.config.ts](../web/next.config.ts)
4. **Optimize Firestore queries** (add indexes, limit results)

### SSL Certificate Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Your connection is not private" warnings
- Mixed content errors

**Solutions:**
- Railway auto-provisions SSL - wait 5-10 minutes after domain setup
- For custom domains: Verify DNS CNAME/A record is correct
- Check domain DNS propagation: [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net)

### Environment Variables Not Updating

**Symptom:**
- Changed variables but app still uses old values

**Solution:**
1. Update variables in Railway dashboard
2. **Redeploy required**: Variables only update on new deployment
3. Manually trigger redeploy:
   - "Deployments" tab → "Deploy" button
   - Or push a commit to trigger auto-deploy

---

## Continuous Deployment

### Automatic Deployment on Git Push

Railway automatically deploys when you push to the configured branch:

1. Make changes locally in `web/` directory
2. Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Update dashboard"`
3. Push to main branch: `git push origin main`
4. Railway detects push and starts deployment automatically
5. Monitor in Railway dashboard "Deployments" tab

**Deployment Triggers:**
- Push to `main` (or configured branch)
- Changes in `web/` directory only (root directory filter)
- `railway.toml` configuration changes

### Branch Deployments

Create preview deployments for testing:

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
2. Make changes and push: `git push origin feature/new-feature`
3. In Railway, click "New Service" → "Deploy from GitHub"
4. Select same repo but different branch
5. Railway creates separate preview deployment

**Use cases:**
- Test changes before merging to main
- Demo features to stakeholders
- Run integration tests in production-like environment

### Rollback to Previous Deployment

If a deployment causes issues:

1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Find last working deployment
3. Click "⋮" menu → "Redeploy"
4. Railway restores previous version

**Or via Git:**
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

```
Railway Dashboard → Service → Deployments → [Latest] → View Logs
```

**Log types:**
- Build logs: npm install, build process
- Runtime logs: Next.js server, application errors
- System logs: Service restarts, crashes

### Set Up Notifications

1. Go to "Settings" → "Notifications"
2. Enable:
   - Deployment success/failure
   - Service crashes
   - Build errors
3. Choose notification method:

## Cost Optimization

### Railway Pricing (as of 2025)

- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month
  - 500 hours execution time
  - $0.000463/GB-hour memory
  - $0.10/GB network egress

- **Pro Plan**: $20/month
  - Unlimited execution time
  - No cold starts
  - Priority support

### Optimization Tips

1. **Use Hobby Plan for Development**
   - Deploy to Railway Hobby for staging
   - Use separate Pro account for production

2. **Optimize Bundle Size**
   - Smaller bundle = faster cold starts
   - Run `npm run build` and check `.next/static` size

3. **Implement Caching**
   - Cache static assets
   - Use Next.js Image Optimization
   - Add CDN for static files (Cloudflare)

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

✅ **Do:**
- Use Railway's "Variables" tab (encrypted at rest)
- Never commit `.env.local` to Git
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix only for client-side vars
- Rotate Firebase credentials periodically

❌ **Don't:**
- Hardcode secrets in code
- Share Firebase service account keys (those are for agent only)
- Use same Firebase project for dev/prod

### Firebase Security

1. **Firestore Security Rules**: Ensure rules restrict access by user/site
2. **Authorized Domains**: Only whitelist your production domains
3. **API Key Restrictions**: Configure in Google Cloud Console
4. **Enable App Check**: Prevent abuse (optional but recommended)

### Next.js Security

The app includes security headers in [next.config.ts](../web/next.config.ts):
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Content-Security-Policy (allows Firebase domains)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin

**Review these headers** if you add third-party integrations.

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Build Command

To customize build process, edit [web/railway.toml](../web/railway.toml):

```toml
[build]
buildCommand = "npm install && npm run custom-build"
```

Then add custom script to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "custom-build": "npm run build && npm run post-build-script"
  }
}
```

### Database Connection (Future)

If you add a database (PostgreSQL, Redis):

1. In Railway, click "New" → "Database"
2. Railway provides connection string as environment variable
3. Access in Next.js via `process.env.DATABASE_URL`

### Background Jobs

Next.js API routes can run background tasks:

```typescript
// app/api/cron/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  // Background job logic
  return Response.json({ status: 'ok' });
}
```

Use Railway Cron (or external service) to trigger periodically.
