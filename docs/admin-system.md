## Firebase Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Complete Firestore and Storage security rules are maintained in the repository root:
- `/firestore.rules` - Complete Firestore security rules
- `/storage.rules` - Complete Storage security rules

For detailed setup instructions, see **[firebase-setup.md](firebase-setup.md)**.

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)

Deploy rules using Firebase CLI:

```bash
# From repository root
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
```

### Manual Deploy

1. **Firestore**: Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules → Copy `/firestore.rules` → Publish
2. **Storage**: Firebase Console → Storage → Rules → Copy `/storage.rules` → Publish

---

### Firestore Data Structure (Admin System)

The system creates the following collections:

```
firestore/
├── users/{userId}
│   ├── email: string
│   ├── role: "user" | "admin"
│   ├── sites: string[]
│   ├── createdAt: Timestamp
│   └── displayName?: string
│
├── installer_metadata/
│   ├── latest                        # Current latest version
│   │   ├── version: "2.0.0"
│   │   ├── download_url: string
│   │   ├── file_size: number
│   │   ├── release_date: Timestamp
│   │   ├── checksum_sha256: string
│   │   ├── release_notes?: string
│   │   └── uploaded_by: string
│   │
│   └── data/versions/{version}       # All versions
│       ├── version: "2.0.0"
│       ├── download_url: string
│       ├── file_size: number
│       ├── release_date: Timestamp
│       ├── checksum_sha256: string
│       ├── release_notes?: string
│       └── uploaded_by: string
│
└── sites/, config/, deployments/     # Existing collections
```

   - Use your own email for testing
   - Or use a test email service
   - Multiple recipients not supported yet

2. **Enter test subject** (optional)
   - Default: "Owlette Test Email"
   - Customize to identify test emails

3. **Enter test message** (optional)
   - Default: "This is a test email from Owlette"
   - Use plain text or HTML

4. **Click "Send Test Email"**
   - API call sent to `/api/test-email`
   - Watch for success/error notification
   - Check recipient inbox

#### Verifying Email Delivery

**Success Indicators**:
- Green toast notification: "Test email sent successfully"
- Email arrives in recipient inbox within 1-2 minutes
- Check spam folder if not received

**Failure Indicators**:
- Red toast notification with error message
- Check browser console for detailed errors
- Check server logs if using SMTP

#### Common Test Scenarios

**1. Verify Email Configuration**
```
Recipient: your-email@example.com
Subject: Owlette Email Config Test
Message: Testing email service configuration
```

**2. Test HTML Rendering**
```
Recipient: your-email@example.com
Subject: HTML Template Test
Message: <h1>Test</h1><p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text</p>
```

**3. Test Special Characters**
```
Recipient: your-email@example.com
Subject: Special Characters Test
Message: Testing émojis 🎉 and spëcial çharacters
```

#### Troubleshooting Email Issues

**Email Not Received**:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify recipient email is valid
3. Check email service quota/limits
4. Review server logs for errors
5. Verify email service credentials

**"Email service not configured" Error**:
1. Ensure email environment variables are set
2. Check `.env.local` for email config
3. Verify email API keys are valid
4. Restart development server

**Rate Limiting Errors**:
1. Wait before sending another test
2. Check email service rate limits
3. Consider upgrading email service plan

#### Security Considerations

**Admin-Only Access**:
- Email testing is restricted to admin users
- RequireAdmin component protects the route
- API endpoint validates admin role

**Abuse Prevention**:
- Consider adding rate limiting to `/api/test-email`
- Log all test email sends for auditing
- Monitor for unusual activity

**Best Practices**:
- Only use test emails during development
- Don't send test emails to customer addresses
- Use dedicated test email accounts
- Clear test emails regularly

### Public Download Button

**Location**: Dashboard header (all users)

**For Regular Users**:
1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Look for download icon in top-right (before profile menu)
3. Hover to see version: "Download Owlette v2.0.0"
4. Click to download latest installer
5. Opens in new tab

**Auto-Updates**:
- Download button automatically updates when admins upload new versions
- No page refresh needed (real-time)
- Always points to latest version

---

## Security Model

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Two Roles**:
1. **user** (default)
   - Access to dashboard
   - View own sites and machines
   - Download latest installer
   - No admin panel access

2. **admin**
   - All user permissions
   - Access to admin panel
   - Manage user roles
   - Upload/delete installer versions
   - Set version as latest

### Authentication Flow

```
User Login → Firebase Auth
     ↓
Fetch user document from Firestore
     ↓
Extract role field
     ↓
Set in AuthContext (isAdmin boolean)
     ↓
UI conditionally shows admin features
```

### Route Protection

**Middleware Level** (server-side):
- `/admin/*` routes require authentication
- Non-logged-in users redirected to login

**Component Level** (client-side):
- `RequireAdmin` component checks `isAdmin`
- Non-admin users redirected to dashboard with error

**Firestore Level**:
- Security rules verify admin role for writes
- Prevents bypassing client-side checks

**Storage Level**:
- Security rules verify admin role for uploads/deletes
- Public read for downloads

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error

**Symptoms**: Admin user sees "You do not have permission to access this page"

**Causes**:
1. Role not set in Firestore
2. User needs to log out and back in
3. Security rules not published

**Solutions**:
1. Check Firestore → users/{uid} → role field
2. Ensure value is exactly `"admin"` (lowercase, no spaces)
3. Log out and log back in
4. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. Verify security rules are published

---

### "Admin Panel" Link Not Showing

**Symptoms**: Profile menu doesn't show admin panel link

**Causes**:
1. Role not set correctly
2. AuthContext not refreshed
3. Browser cache issue

**Solutions**:
1. Check Firestore role field
2. Log out and log back in
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check browser console for errors

---

### Upload Fails

**Symptoms**: Installer upload fails or shows error

**Causes**:
1. Storage security rules not configured
2. Not logged in as admin
3. File too large
4. Network issue

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Storage rules allow admin writes
2. Check role in Firestore
3. Try smaller file or better internet
4. Check browser console for error details
5. Verify Firebase Storage quota not exceeded

---

### Download Button Not Showing

**Symptoms**: Download button missing from dashboard

**Causes**:
1. No installer versions uploaded yet
2. Firestore security rules blocking read
3. Component error

**Solutions**:
1. Upload at least one installer version
2. Verify Firestore rules allow public read for `installer_metadata`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` env vars are set

---

### Version Not Updating

**Symptoms**: Download button shows old version after upload

**Causes**:
1. "Set as latest" not checked during upload
2. Firestore listener not active
3. Browser cache issue

**Solutions**:
1. Manually set version as latest in admin panel
2. Refresh page
3. Check browser console for Firestore errors
4. Verify real-time listeners are working

---

## Best Practices

### User Management
- Limit number of admin users (principle of least privilege)
- Regularly audit admin users
- Document who has admin access and why
- Use dedicated admin accounts (not shared)

### Installer Management
- Always add release notes for versions
- Test installers before setting as latest
- Keep at least 2-3 versions for rollback
- Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Delete very old versions to save storage costs

### Security
- Never commit Firebase credentials
- Rotate admin users periodically
- Monitor Firestore usage for unusual activity
- Enable Firebase App Check for additional security
- Review security rules after any changes
