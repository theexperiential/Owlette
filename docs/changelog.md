## [3.3.2] - 2026-09-09

### fixed — a failed display enumeration is no longer reported as monitors being removed

When the agent could not read the display configuration at all, it reported that
as every monitor having been disconnected: one CRITICAL alert per panel, emailed
immediately, naming displays that were still plugged in. The dashboard kept
showing those monitors present the whole time, because the upload path already
refused the bad reading while the alert path did not.

It also remembered the empty reading, so the next successful check announced
every monitor as newly *added* — a disconnect/reconnect flap for each failure.

The agent now treats "I could not look" as its own case: no alert, no state
change, and the reading is discarded rather than remembered.

This only affects alerts caused by a failed enumeration. A check that succeeds
but returns an incomplete monitor list is a separate case and still alerts; if
you are seeing these, the agent log records `build_display_profile: enumeration
failed` at the moment of each affected alert when this fix applies.

### changed — the service host is rebuilt with version metadata, after Defender began quarantining it

On 2026-09-08 Windows Defender's machine-learning classifier (definition set
1.459.111.0) started quarantining `owlette-host.exe` — the Windows service
that supervises the agent — as `Trojan:Win32/Bearfoos.B!ml`. It was a false
positive on the file's shape, not its behaviour: a small, size-optimised,
stripped, statically linked executable with no version information is also
what a malware dropper looks like. When Defender opened the file it removed
both the file and the `OwletteService` registration. The agent's Python
process survived as an orphan and kept reporting the machine healthy, so the
dashboard did not notice.

Every installer from 3.2.3 to 3.3.1 ships that binary. 3.3.2 rebuilds it with
a proper Windows version resource (company, product, description, file
version) and an ordinary release profile; current definitions scan the result
clean, including under real-time protection. The static CRT link introduced in
3.2.3 is kept — it is what lets the service start on a freshly imaged machine.

If a machine on 3.2.3–3.3.1 shows `OwletteService` missing while the dashboard
still shows it online, this is why. Install 3.3.2 over it; the installer
replaces the host and re-registers the service. No Defender exclusion is
needed for owlette, and the installer does not add one.

## [3.3.1] - 2026-09-08

> This release removes a public API surface and changes who may do what on a
> site. Both are breaking changes; the version is a patch bump by release
> decision, so read the two `breaking` sections below before upgrading.

### breaking — site roles are per site, and a global admin no longer grants access

Who can do what on a site is now decided by that person's role **on that site**,
not by their account-level role. The same person can own one site, administer a
second and be a plain member of a third.

Previously an account-level `admin` was treated as an administrator of every
site it could reach. One role, granted once, applied everywhere — so adding
someone to a second site silently handed them administrative rights there too.
That is closed: an account-level `admin` role now grants **nothing** on a site
by itself. Only a platform superadmin still reaches every site.

**the three per-site roles**
- **owner** — everything an admin can do, plus deleting the site and
  transferring ownership. Every site has exactly one, and an owner cannot be
  demoted in place; ownership moves by transfer.
- **admin** — machine commands and configuration, deployments, roosts, talons,
  webhooks, logs, and managing membership.
- **member** — read-only: view machines, capture screenshots, open live view.

**what changes for you**

Adding a member as an `admin` now genuinely makes them an admin of that site.
Before, the request was recorded and then quietly downgraded unless the account
already held a global admin role — the dashboard, the API response and both SDKs
all reported that downgrade even when a real site-admin grant had been written.
Roles are also editable per site from the members page; the old advice to contact
support to change a role no longer applies.

**enrolling a machine now requires site-admin.** Generating an installer, minting
a setup token, or authorizing a pairing code all issue a machine identity plus a
non-expiring refresh token, and revoking one has always been an administrator's
job — so issuing one can no longer be less. A plain **member** who currently runs
installers will receive `403` after this release. Promote the people who deploy
your machines to **admin** on the sites they deploy to.

**for operators upgrading**

Membership rows are created by a one-time backfill that must land together with
the security rules and the collection-group index — in that order, index first.
Until all three are live, per-site access cannot be resolved. If you self-host,
run `scripts/migrations/backfill-per-site-membership.mjs` (it has a `--verify`
mode and a rollback path) before promoting the web release.

`roleHonored` in the add-member API response is now always `true` and is
retained only so the response shape does not change. It previously reported
whether an account's global role would make an `admin` request stick, which is
no longer how any of this works.


### fixed — agent: three faults that made the fleet quieter than it should have been

**The roost kill switch had never actually stopped anything on an agent.** The agent read
the flag through a method its Firestore client does not have, swallowed the resulting error,
and cached the failure as "enabled" for the full TTL — so no request was ever made and the
switch was never observed, while the changelog said it was checked before every sync. Agents
now read `roostEnabled` from the server-mediated `/api/agent/site` projection, and a disabled
site genuinely halts new roost work.

**A stalled display enumeration could stall the heartbeat, and the machine would read
offline.** Two watchdogs used a thread-pool context manager whose exit waits for the worker,
so the timeout they advertised bounded nothing: the call blocked for the full duration of the
very hang the watchdog existed to survive. One of them was the only bound on the heartbeat
path. Both now abandon the stalled worker, as two sibling watchdogs in the same codebase
already did.

**A screenshot request could freeze process monitoring for the better part of a minute.** The
Cortex/hoot IPC pump ran on the 5-second service loop, and a single `capture_screenshot`
takes around 55 seconds end to end. It now runs off the loop, one at a time, with the same
result contract.

### breaking — the legacy by-URL distribution path is removed

roost is now the only way to get files onto a machine. The v1 "point the fleet at a hosted ZIP and let the agent download and extract it" path is gone in one clean cut — no deprecation window, no compatibility shim. An agent that receives a `distribute_project` command now logs and skips it.

**removal surface**
- API routes: `POST|GET /api/sites/{siteId}/project-distributions`, `GET|DELETE /api/sites/{siteId}/project-distributions/{distId}`, and `POST /api/sites/{siteId}/project-distributions/{distId}/cancel` all 404. Their OpenAPI paths and the `listProjectDistributions` / `createProjectDistribution` / `getProjectDistribution` / `deleteProjectDistribution` / `cancelProjectDistribution` operations are dropped from the published spec.
- Agent commands: `distribute_project` and `cancel_distribution` no longer have handlers, and `agent/src/project_utils.py` (download, ZIP extract, verify, cleanup) is deleted. The agent no longer extracts archives at all.
- Dashboard: the roost dialog's `by url` source picker and its project-URL field are gone — uploading a folder is the only source. Saved distribution presets are unaffected; a stored `project_url` on one is simply no longer read.
- Security rules (2.9.0): the `sites/{siteId}/project_distributions/{distributionId}` block is removed, so the collection falls through to default-deny for every verb.

**data at rest** — existing `project_distributions` documents are **not** deleted. They stay in Firestore, unreachable from any client or server route. Nothing reads them; no archival or purge job was run.

**migration** — recreate any recurring by-URL deployment as a roost: open `/roosts`, click `new roost`, drop the project folder, and pick the same target machines. You get content-addressed chunking, resumable uploads, immutable versions, and one-click rollback, none of which the URL path ever had.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-09-05

### changed

- **owlette now only ever manages processes it launched or deliberately inherited.** every launch — and every deliberate adoption of an already-running instance — writes a durable identity record: the PID plus the process's creation time and the executable it runs. every kill, restart, stall recovery, schedule-window stop, and deployment close the agent performs first proves the live process still matches that record, and refuses rather than guesses — a PID that Windows has recycled, a process whose identity cannot be read, or a record belonging to a different entry comes back as a plain `Error:` result naming the reason. previous versions never re-verified a PID before terminating it.
- **where owlette previously adopted an arbitrary same-image instance, it now launches a fresh one it can identify.** several instances of one executable with nothing configured to tell them apart used to be resolved by picking one — and picking wrong meant monitoring, and eventually killing, a process owlette never launched. ambiguity now means a fresh launch. this is safe because the identity record makes owlette re-recognise its own child after every service restart: an entry can produce a duplicate at most once, ever, and then converges on the instance owlette launched. setting the entry's path/args tells instances apart up front and avoids even that one duplicate.
- **upgrading re-verifies every supervised process; most carry over untouched.** state files written by earlier versions carry no identity records, so on its first start after the upgrade owlette does not trust recorded PIDs. an instance it can still identify unambiguously — the entry's path/args in the process's command line, or the only instance of its executable on the machine — is inherited in place and recorded: no restart, no interruption. an entry whose instance cannot be told apart from look-alikes launches fresh instead, and the unidentifiable instance is left running unmanaged — owlette will not terminate a process it cannot verify — so close such stragglers by hand, or set path/args before upgrading so there are none. every service restart after that re-adopts exactly the instances owlette launched or inherited.

### fixed

- **a deployment's close_processes no longer kills by image name across the whole machine.** previously every process on the box whose filename matched a close name died — owlette's or not: a deployment closing `TouchDesigner.exe` took down every TouchDesigner on the machine. close names now resolve to configured entries, and from there to those entries' recorded instances only, each identity-verified before the terminate; a name matching no managed entry is logged and skipped.
- **a process that cannot be launched or verified now shows as failed.** the red `LAUNCH_FAILED` state has been rendered by the desktop app and the dashboard for years, but nothing ever wrote it — a broken executable path or a refused operation left the entry on the hollow inactive ring, indistinguishable from a launch mode set to off. it is now written whenever the executable cannot be resolved, a launch fails, or an operation is refused because the process could not be verified as owlette's, and it clears on the entry's next successful launch. the one gap is an entry that has never launched at all: with no status row to carry the mark, it stays inactive, and the log and the command result are the only signals.

## [3.2.4] - 2026-09-05

### changed

- **internal cleanup only — no behaviour changes.** this release removes code that stopped being reachable when the python interface was replaced in 3.0.0, and folds several copy-pasted implementations into one each. the tkinter colour tables, window-title lookups and window-closing routine that served the old interface are gone, along with a handful of functions and parameters nothing had called since. the three near-identical screenshot pipelines, the token-cloning logic that existed in two modules, and the command-completion writers that differed only in a status word now each have a single implementation. agents on 3.2.3 gain nothing by updating; the value is in a smaller, clearer codebase for what comes next.

## [3.2.3] - 2026-08-30

### fixed

- **self-updates no longer raise a UAC prompt on every machine.** while an update was installing, the desktop app saw the service stop, tried to start it back up, and — lacking the right — fell back to an elevated command, putting a "Windows Command Processor" consent prompt over whatever was on screen, fleet-wide. the app now stands down entirely while an update is in progress (the installer stops the service on purpose, restarts it itself, and has a watchdog for the failure case), and automatic starts never elevate at all — the UAC path is reserved for a deliberate click on the start button or the tray menu.

## [3.2.2] - 2026-08-30

### changed

- **kill and restart now follow whether a process is running, never its launch mode.** in both the dashboard and the desktop app, a running process can be restarted or killed whatever its launch mode — switching a running process to off no longer takes the controls away — and a process that is not running has both buttons greyed out. previously the dashboard offered kill on any off-mode process even when nothing was running, and the desktop app refused to kill a running process that had just been switched to off.
- **restarting a process whose launch mode is off now actually restarts it.** the service relaunches it once and then goes back to leaving it alone; previously a restart from the desktop app only stopped it.
- **the desktop app's process form is grouped into three collapsible sections** — what to run, when to run, how to run — and the open state of each is remembered per user across launches. delay and wait moved beside the launch mode under *when to run*; attempts, priority, and visibility make up *how to run*, absorbing the old advanced section. the compact fields flow into two or three columns when the window is wide enough.

### fixed

- **the desktop app no longer reports "no running instance" when restarting a process that is clearly running.** when the service's process table held a stale generation alongside the live one, the app could pick the dead entry and give up; it now tries every candidate until it finds the one that is alive.
- **the desktop kill button is red, matching the dashboard,** and the dashboard's restart icon now matches the desktop app's counter-clockwise arrow.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-08-29

### fixed

- **the service now starts on machines that have never had the Visual C++ runtime installed.** `owlette-host.exe` was linked against `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, which ships with the Visual C++ redistributable rather than with Windows. on a freshly imaged machine the install completed normally and then the service refused to start with *"the code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found"*, leaving the dashboard reporting the machine as service not running. the host is now statically linked and depends on nothing beyond Windows itself. machines that already carried the redistributable — which is most machines with development tooling or common desktop software on them — were never affected; this only ever hit clean images, which is precisely what kiosks, signage players and media servers are.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-24

### changed

- **temperature monitoring no longer uses the WinRing0 driver.** CPU and GPU temperatures now come from LibreHardwareMonitor 0.9.6 through [PawnIO](https://pawnio.eu/) — a Microsoft-signed, sandboxed kernel driver that is HVCI-compatible and not on any vulnerable-driver blocklist. previous versions bundled a library that extracted the deprecated WinRing0 1.2.0.5 driver at runtime as `python.sys` and re-registered it as kernel service `R0python` on every boot, with no way for an operator to opt out. upgrading removes that driver, deletes its services, and prunes the library that extracted it — nothing can bring it back. the installer deploys PawnIO 2.2.0 only when it is absent or older (2.2.0 fixes boot-loops on Windows 10 1809/LTSC machines that earlier PawnIO builds caused), and leaves it in place on uninstall since other tools share it. dashboard temperature readings, history, and talons thresholds are unchanged.
- **the Windows Defender exclusions previous installers added are retracted on upgrade.** the exclusions existed solely because Defender (correctly) flagged the WinRing0 driver; with it gone, the installer actively removes every exclusion any previous version ever added — including the whole-install directory exclusions from early versions — so owlette no longer asks Defender to look away from anything. the retraction is logged to `logs\defender_setup.log`.

### added

- **temperature monitoring can be switched off.** set `"temperature": { "enabled": false }` in `config.json` to stop all sensor reads — the section is created on upgrade with the default `true`, and a missing section means enabled. machines without the PawnIO driver keep working: CPU temperatures read as blank and GPU temperatures still arrive through vendor APIs.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-22

### added

- **every pairing surface now names the owlette server it is talking to.** the pairing window shows the host it will authorize against and carries a `dev` badge on anything that is not production, the desktop app's footer badges the environment the machine is actually bound to, and the authorization page states which host you are on. a phrase minted on one server and typed into the other is the most common way pairing fails, and it now announces itself before you type anything.
- **A passkey now counts as your second factor.** Setting one up satisfies 2FA outright, and signing in with it clears both the password step and the second factor in a single ceremony — no code to type afterwards. "Passkey" means whatever already unlocks your device: Windows Hello, Touch ID, Face ID, a hardware security key, or a password manager that stores passkeys (1Password, Bitwarden, iCloud Keychain). They are all the same WebAuthn standard, so there is nothing per-vendor to enable.
- **Backup codes for any account, not just authenticator ones.** A passkey-only account used to have no recovery material at all. Every enrolled account can now hold a sheet, and regenerate it from account settings — which invalidates the old one. Regeneration asks you to prove a factor in the same step (a current 6-digit code, an unused backup code, or your passkey), because a fresh sheet of recovery codes is powerful enough to switch 2FA off entirely.
- **Account settings lists your second factors in one place.** Authenticator app and passkeys, when each was added, and add/remove controls for both, with a warning when you are down to your last one.
- **Superadmins can reset the 2FA on a locked-out account.** **reset 2FA**, on the row menu of the admin users page, clears every factor — authenticator app, passkeys, and backup codes — re-arms mandatory setup, and revokes that user's trusted devices, so their next sign-in starts enrollment from scratch. It does not revoke Firebase refresh tokens, so a session they already hold stays signed in until it expires on its own. Superadmins cannot reset themselves. Recovering a locked-out user previously meant hand-editing Firestore.

### changed

- **pairing happens in the owlette window now, not a console.** the installer hands off to the app, which opens on **join a site** showing the pairing phrase, the authorization link, and a button that opens that link on this machine. the console window that used to appear part-way through the install is gone. machines with no webview2 runtime, and `/ADD=` bulk installs, still pair on the console as before.
- **the service is installed whether or not pairing completes.** it used to be skipped the moment pairing failed, which left the machine with no supervisor at all — the worst possible outcome of a mistyped phrase. a machine that never pairs now ends up with a registered, running service that simply has no site to talk to yet, and the installer says exactly how to finish pairing later. a silent install with no `/ADD=` phrase now skips pairing outright instead of spending ten minutes waiting on a phrase nobody can read.
- **breaking: `--url` on the pairing helper now requires `--server`.** the url no longer implies an environment, so pointing the helper at a local or custom api base without naming dev or prod stops with an error instead of quietly writing production credentials for a development server. this affects local development only; `/SERVER=dev` and `/SERVER=prod` on the installer are unchanged.
- **2FA setup starts with a choice instead of a QR code.** The setup screen now offers a passkey (recommended) or an authenticator app, and says plainly that authenticator apps run on **desktop as well as mobile** — 1Password, Bitwarden, and Authy all have desktop apps, so signing up no longer depends on having a phone to hand.
- **Removing your last second factor is allowed.** The account immediately re-arms 2FA setup: you will be asked to enroll a new factor — a passkey or an authenticator app — before you can use the dashboard again, and trusted devices are revoked at the same time.
- **Adding a factor to an account that already has one asks you to verify first.** Enrollment on a warm session now requires a cleared 2FA challenge, so someone with a signed-in browser cannot quietly attach a factor of their own. Verify with an existing passkey, or take the code prompt.
- **`mfaEnrolled` is derived, not declared.** The user document carries an `mfaFactors` tally (`{ totp, passkeys }`), and `mfaEnrolled` / `requiresMfaSetup` are computed from it by a single server-side writer. The old `passkeyEnrolled` flag is retired.

### fixed

- **a failed re-pair during an upgrade no longer leaves the machine with a stopped service.** upgrading a machine while moving it to another server, or re-pairing one whose credentials had gone stale, abandoned the service install as soon as pairing failed — so a working machine came out of the upgrade worse off than it went in. installing the service no longer depends on pairing succeeding.
- **the dashboard's silent-install command now targets the server the phrase was generated on.** on dev the copied command was missing `/SERVER=dev`, so every machine it was pasted into installed against production, never found the phrase, and failed to pair. the flag is now part of both the command shown and the command copied.

### removed

- **the `/OPENBROWSER=` installer flag and the pairing helper's `--open-browser` option are gone.** nothing on a target machine opens a browser by itself any more — you authorize from the pairing window's own button, or from a phone or another computer. `--no-browser` and `OWLETTE_NO_BROWSER=1` are still accepted so existing deployment scripts keep running, but they no longer change anything.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-08-20

### fixed

- **config changes made on the machine now reach the cloud — and survive reboots.** since 3.0.0, edits made in the desktop app (launch modes, paths, schedules, everything) were applied locally but never uploaded, and the next reboot silently reverted them to the cloud's stale copy. the agent now pushes local edits within about a second of the change, and startup reconciles three ways instead of blindly preferring the cloud: a newer local change is pushed up, a newer cloud change is pulled down, and a genuine conflict prefers the cloud while logging exactly what it discarded.
- **a clean windows shutdown is no longer reported as an "unexpected reboot".** the agent asks windows for up to 45 seconds of shutdown notice (previously ~5), receives a stop signal directly from the service host instead of polling for it, records the clean stop locally before attempting any network calls, and cross-checks the windows event log before raising the alarm.
- **the tray icon no longer sticks on the gray "disconnected" owl after a reboot.** when the app starts before the windows taskbar exists, refused icon updates are now retried until one lands, and the icon re-asserts itself once a minute.
- **editing a process on the dashboard no longer fails with "duplicate process name" when older duplicates already exist in the config.** only changes that introduce or worsen a name collision are rejected — cleanup renames and unrelated edits save normally.
- **the dashboard renders display-capture timestamps synced by the agent** instead of showing "never" for string-typed values.

### changed

- **new processes get unique default names** ("untitled process 2", …) instead of repeating the same name, which the dashboard rejects as a duplicate.
- **shutting the machine down can take up to ~20 seconds longer** while the agent flushes its state gracefully — this window is what makes settings and clean-shutdown records survive the power-off.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-08-17

### added

- **Suppress the Windows setup screens, fleet-wide.** A new hoot tool turns off the full-screen interruptions Windows shows at sign-in after updates — the privacy chooser, the Welcome Experience, "let's finish setting up your device", and the Edge first-run tour — for every profile on the machine, including accounts created later. A built-in talons preset, **update guard**, re-asserts the suppression and the update window every Sunday morning, since feature updates are known to reset these keys.

### fixed

- **The tray icon stops flashing red on a machine that is actually connected.** On a cold boot the agent's health check often runs seconds before Windows finishes bringing the network up and records "network not reachable" — and that verdict was never revisited, so even after the agent connected moments later (and stayed connected) the tray flashed red for the machine's entire uptime while the window footer correctly said "connected". The health state now clears the moment a connection is established — at startup, and after any mid-run outage — and the tray itself now treats a live connection as proof that a leftover error is stale.
- **Recovering from an internet outage clears the error, not just the badge.** A machine that lost and regained its connection kept its "connection failure" health error, with the same forever-flashing icon. Reconnection now resets it.
- **A machine that isn't registered no longer blames the network.** When the health check ran before the network was up, its "network unreachable" verdict could stand in for the real problem. Once the network gate opens, the checks now run again, so an unauthenticated machine reports "authentication required" instead of a phantom network error.
- **A machine whose cloud client failed to start recovers on its own.** If cloud initialization failed at startup, nothing retried it and the machine stayed invisible on the dashboard until someone restarted the service. The agent now notices "cloud enabled, but nothing serving it" and reinitializes, retrying every five minutes until it succeeds.
- **roost's hourly maintenance no longer crashes on databases from interim builds.** Some 3.0.0 machines carried a sync-state database created with the new column names but stamped with the old schema version; the migration then failed on every run, permanently killing the on-disk scrub and the orphan-chunk cleanup. The migration now checks what actually needs renaming and brings those databases forward cleanly.
- **The local status file reports the real time of the last heartbeat** instead of always claiming there had never been one.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-16

### added

- **A new desktop app replaces the old agent window.** Process management now lives in a proper application: add a process by dragging its file onto the window, edit schedules inline, watch live status, and reach pairing, the recovery menu, and start-on-login from the tray. It ships with the installer and replaces the Python interface entirely.
- **talons — automation that runs on your machines.** Build a rule as trigger → condition → outputs: react to a crash, a display change, a schedule, or a webhook, then restart something, send an alert, run a command, or ask hoot to look at a screenshot and decide. Presets cover the common cases, and you can bring your own LLM key per site.
- **The dashboard works on a phone.** Machines, logs, hoot conversations, dialogs, and site management are all usable on a small screen, with touch-sized controls throughout.

### changed

- **Breaking: the agent runs under a new service host.** Owlette no longer uses NSSM; it is hosted by our own supervisor, which stops cleanly through Windows' own service controls with a grace period, backs off after a crash loop instead of restarting forever, registers real Windows failure actions, and writes its own log at `logs\service_host.log`. Upgrades migrate the service registration in place and remove `nssm.exe` — no reinstall, and supervised processes keep running through the migration. Agents older than 3.0.0 are not compatible with this host.
- **Cortex is now hoot.** Routes, screens, and documentation use the new name, and `/cortex` links redirect permanently. The API keeps its `/api/cortex/*` paths working, so existing CLI and SDK integrations need no changes.
- **The installer is much smaller.** The Claude CLI is downloaded and checksum-verified on first use rather than shipped inside the installer, and machines that already have a matching copy reuse it.
- **One Start-menu entry.** "Owlette" opens the app. The old tray-only launcher, which appeared to do nothing when clicked, and the separate "Owlette Configuration" entry are both retired and removed on upgrade.

### removed

- **The legacy Python interface is gone**, and upgrading prunes its leftover files and logs.
- **Site tiers and billing are removed.** The `core`/`pro` distinction no longer gates anything — every feature, including talons, is available to all sites.

### fixed

- **Starting a process that is already running no longer launches a second copy.** Starting a process from the dashboard, or from hoot's self-healing, decided whether it was already running by looking only at the PID Owlette itself last launched. A process that was live but untracked — anything with its launch mode set to off, or an instance that outlived a service restart — looked absent, so the start landed a duplicate on top of it. Both paths now search for a matching instance first and adopt it instead. Matching is project-aware: several instances of one application are normal, so a TouchDesigner instance is identified by the `.toe` it has open, not just by `TouchDesigner.exe`. When a process entry had no file configured to tell instances apart, only the kill and restart paths declined to guess — adoption still picked the first instance matching the executable. (3.3.0 makes refusal universal.)
- **Restarting a `.bat` or `.cmd` process no longer leaves the old one running.** Scripts start through a `cmd.exe` wrapper, so the process Owlette tracked was the wrapper rather than the script's real work. Stopping or restarting killed the wrapper and reported success while the actual process kept running — still holding its files, its port, or its GPU — and invisible to Owlette from then on. The payload is now shut down along with its wrapper. Ordinary `.exe` processes are unaffected: applications that manage their own helpers, like TouchDesigner, still close them in their own time.
- **A hung process no longer reads as "inactive" in the local app.** When a process stops responding, the agent marks it stalled — but the desktop app didn't recognise that state, so it displayed the process as inactive and greyed out the restart button, at exactly the moment an operator would want it. It now shows as stalled and stays actionable, matching how the dashboard has always treated it.
- **Setting relaunch attempts to 0 really does mean unlimited.** The field is documented as "0 is unlimited", and the agent's reboot-escalation check was written to honour it, but a zero was being read as "not set" and silently replaced with the default of 3 — so a machine configured never to reboot itself would reboot after three failed relaunches. A zero is now preserved end to end, through the agent, the API, and the dashboard's edit form. A blank or non-numeric value still falls back to 3.
- **Two launches can no longer race each other.** The monitoring loop, dashboard commands, and remote config updates each run on their own thread, and nothing stopped two of them from deciding a process needed launching at the same moment. Launches are now serialised per process, a restart holds that claim across both the stop and the start, and a launch that loses the race adopts the winner's process instead of starting another.
- **Leftover scheduled tasks from old agents are cleaned up.** Agents older than 2.1.1 started supervised processes through Windows Task Scheduler and created one task per launch, which were meant to be deleted moments later but survived whenever a launch was interrupted. Long-lived machines accumulated dozens, where they were easily mistaken for a second Owlette autostart. The agent now removes them once, on first start after upgrading. Only the two task shapes Owlette generated are matched, and only when they carry no trigger that could still fire — update tasks, and anything named by a technician, are left alone.
- **Display alerts actually arrive again.** Display events — a monitor disappearing, a layout apply failing, genlock dropping, resolution drifting — were written to the dashboard event feed but never handed to the alert pipeline, so the emails and webhooks they were supposed to trigger had been silent fleet-wide. The agent now sends them, and the `display alerts` preference, the display digest, and display webhooks work as documented. Requires the new agent; older agents keep logging the events to the dashboard as before.
- **roost deployments finish, roll back, and report honestly.** A rollout to a single machine could sit at in-progress after the file sync had actually completed, rollback restored a version record without restoring the files it named, and a deployment that failed part-way could still read as successful. Rollouts now complete, rollback returns the machine to the exact files it ran before, failures say so, and the `rolled_back` webhook fires. Abandoned transfers are cleaned up rather than left occupying disk.
- **A site you create yourself is visible to you.** Signing up and creating your first site wrote the site but never added it to your own account, so the dashboard came up empty until someone else invited you to it.
- **The online badge respects a stale heartbeat.** A machine could show as online from a cached snapshot after it had stopped reporting; the badge now checks how recent the heartbeat is before showing green.

## [2.12.21] - 2026-08-12

### fixed

- **Machines come online seconds after power-on, not minutes.** The agent previously waited out a blind two-minute startup delay, and a first connection attempt made before the network was ready could lock it out for several more minutes even after the network came up. The service now checks for real network readiness at startup and, when the network isn't up yet, retries every few seconds instead of backing off — longer waits are reserved for genuine server errors.
- **Restarting the agent no longer flickers the machine offline.** Owlette-initiated restarts (a tray restart or the agent's own recovery watchdog) return within seconds, but used to mark the machine offline on the way out — producing a visible offline/online flap and sometimes a spurious alert. The dashboard now stays green through these restarts. Stopping the service yourself, or shutting the machine down, still marks it offline immediately.
- **A single slow heartbeat no longer greys out a healthy machine.** The offline threshold was three minutes against a two-minute idle heartbeat — one delayed beat away from a false alarm. The dashboard and the offline-alert email now both wait five minutes, so a machine has to miss more than two consecutive heartbeats before it is called offline.

## [2.12.20] - 2026-08-08

### security

- **The agent's bundled dependencies are updated and trimmed.** setuptools and requests move to versions clearing several published advisories, and three unused Google API libraries left over from an old Firebase integration are removed entirely — 17 fewer packages, and a smaller installer. None of the advisories were reachable from owlette; this is dependency hygiene rather than a fix for anything exploitable.
- **A fresh install now reports its bundled libraries accurately.** Earlier installers could record two conflicting versions of the same library, so a vulnerability scanner reading a machine might report one version while different code was what actually ran. A new install now carries exactly one version of each library, and the build fails outright if its dependencies disagree.
- **Known limitation — upgrading in place does not clear the old versions.** Installing over an existing agent replaces files but leaves the previous version's records behind, so a machine upgraded several times still reports stale versions to a scanner even though the current code is what runs. Only a fresh install gives an accurate reading today. Uninstalling first preserves your configuration, tokens, and logs.

### changed

- **The agent's HTTP layer moves off an end-of-life release.** One of the removed Google libraries had been holding the networking stack on a 2024 version that no longer receives fixes. Nothing about how the agent talks to owlette changes — it is simply maintained again.

## [2.12.19] - 2026-08-07

### added

- **Duplicate a process.** Right-click a process in the agent app or use the new duplicate action on the dashboard (list and card views) to clone its full configuration. The copy gets a "(copy)" name and starts with launch mode off, so it never spawns a second instance until you're ready.

### fixed

- **Hidden window mode now works for scripts and console apps.** Processes set to hidden no longer show a command-prompt window when the target is a `.bat`/`.cmd` script or a console `.exe` — including scripts under paths with spaces.
- **`.bat` and `.cmd` are first-class process targets.** The agent's file browser now lets you pick scripts (`.exe`, `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.com`, or any file) instead of requiring a hand-typed path, and hidden script launches work end-to-end.
- **Kill works regardless of launch mode.** Killing a process whose launch mode is off (or that owlette didn't start itself) now finds and terminates the live instance — from the dashboard, the agent app, and Cortex. The agent app previously killed a stale recorded process id and reported success while the real process kept running; it now validates the recorded id against the configured executable (so it can never terminate an unrelated recycled process id) and falls back to locating the live instance, refusing rather than guessing when several instances of the same executable are indistinguishable. Restarting such a process no longer launches a duplicate on top of the live one.
- **The restart countdown window matches the app theme.** The countdown dialog now uses the dark navy/cyan theme instead of the legacy grey, and the timer is zero-padded (1:05, not 1:5).
- **"open owlette" from the tray reliably shows the window.** The tray could focus one of the app's invisible tooltip popups (they share the main window's title) instead of the app itself, leaving an already-open window in the background. It now targets the real window and restores it, doesn't respawn the app while a fresh launch is still starting up, and launches the app with the bundled interpreter instead of whatever python is on PATH (which could crash silently on machines with another Python installed).
- **"Trust this device for 30 days" now works.** Checking the box at the two-factor prompt stores a secure token in that browser, so sign-ins from it skip the code for the next 30 days. Signing out doesn't clear it; disabling 2FA or deleting the account revokes every trusted device.
- **No more daily two-factor prompts.** A verified session now survives page reloads and new tabs for its full lifetime — previously any fresh page load could reset the session's verified state and bounce you back to the code screen.
- **2FA codes autofill.** The verification fields identify themselves as one-time-code inputs, so password managers and phone keyboards offer the code automatically (backup codes still type normally).

### changed

- **Offline alert emails are consolidated and accurate.** When several machines at a site go offline around the same time, one email now lists the full picture — machines not responding, machines that reported shutting down, and machines still offline from an earlier alert — with a subject count that matches the list. Previously a staggered site-wide outage produced several emails with partial counts. Alerts wait for the situation to stabilize (about ten minutes) before sending.

### security

- **The bundled cryptography library is updated to 50.0.0.** This clears three published advisories against the previous version (CVE-2026-69247, CVE-2026-69249, CVE-2026-69248). None of them were reachable from owlette — the affected PKCS#7 decryption and X.509 chain-verification routines are not used by the agent, which relies on the library only for token encryption and device-code pairing. The update keeps the bundled dependency clean for operators who run vulnerability scanners against their machines.

## [2.12.18] - 2026-07-09

### fixed

- **Cortex "cancel" now actually stops a running tool.** The cancel control reached the agent but couldn't identify which command to kill (it read the target command id from the wrong place), so the tool ran to its timeout as if nothing happened. Cancelling a `run_command` / `run_powershell` / `execute_script` now terminates the process tree within a few seconds and resolves the tool card to "cancelled by user".

## [2.12.17] - 2026-07-08

### fixed

- **Agent roost sync-state database migrates itself.** Agents whose local roost sync database predated an internal rename would fail their hourly integrity check (and any future sync) with an internal "No item with that key" error. The database now upgrades itself in place on startup, preserving existing state.

## [2.12.16] - 2026-07-07

### fixed

- **Cancelling a running tool now works for every shell tool.** The cancel control added in 2.12.15 only stopped `execute_script` — a running `run_powershell` or `run_command` ignored the cancel and ran to completion. All three shell tools now register their process, so cancel terminates the process tree within a few seconds and the tool card resolves to "cancelled by user".

## [2.12.15] - 2026-07-07

### added

- **Antifragile Cortex chat (async turns).** A chat turn's model loop and tool execution are now decoupled from the browser connection. Long-running tools (e.g. `sfc /scannow`, DISM, multi-minute scripts) keep running and their results still land in the chat even if the connection drops, the tab is closed, or the page is reloaded mid-turn — the client reattaches to the in-flight turn and streams it live from the backend.
- **Cancel a running tool.** Running tool calls now show a cancel control that terminates the process tree on the machine within a few seconds and reports the cancellation back to the chat.
- **Stop a turn.** The stop control now halts the whole turn server-side instead of only the local view.

### fixed

- **Chats can no longer be bricked by an interrupted tool call.** A tool call whose result was lost mid-stream is repaired into an honest error (or recovered from the machine's completed-command record) so the conversation always continues; sending a new message while a tool is still running no longer produces a provider error.
- **Agent robustness.** Long tool scripts are terminated cleanly on cancellation; a mid-command service restart no longer silently re-runs the interrupted command or strands a deployment as in-progress; `execute_script` timeouts are capped to keep results retrievable.
- **User-attached images** in Cortex chat now align with the sender's message.

### security

- **Cortex chat ownership is enforced server-side.** Sending or stopping a turn now verifies the caller owns the target conversation, preventing cross-user chat modification.

## [2.12.14] - 2026-07-03

### fixed

- **Agent pairing no longer opens a browser without operator action.** Interactive installer pairing now prints the phrase and URL, starts polling immediately, and offers `press Enter to open the pairing page in your browser` as the opt-in path. The desktop app join-site dialog also waits for the user to click its existing open button instead of launching a browser automatically.

### added

- **`--open-browser` pairing option** for operators who explicitly want the old immediate-open behavior during manual `configure_site.py` runs. `--no-browser` and `OWLETTE_NO_BROWSER=1` still suppress any local browser affordance.

## [2.12.13] - 2026-07-03

### fixed

- **The desktop app's "join site" button now actually pairs the machine.** Previously it opened no browser and showed no pairing phrase — it just polled silently, so there was no way to know what to do next. It now shows the 3-word pairing phrase in a dialog (copied to your clipboard automatically, click it to copy again), opens owlette.app/add in your browser, and reports progress; the service restarts on its own once you authorize from any device. You can cancel at any time without waiting for the code to expire.
- **Revoking a machine's token no longer risks disconnecting other machines that share its hostname.** The revoke dialog now offers "revoke current token" (only the most-recently-used token for that hostname) alongside "revoke all for hostname" (the previous behavior, now clearly labelled). Machines cloned to the same hostname are no longer knocked offline when you revoke just one.

### added

- **The pairing phrase is copied to your clipboard during install.** When the installer displays the 3-word phrase, it's already on your clipboard to paste straight into owlette.app/add — no retyping. Best-effort, so a busy clipboard never blocks pairing.
- **The agent-tokens admin can be searched, filtered, and pruned.** Search by machine id or agent, filter by version, flag hostname duplicates, and prune tokens that are provably expired. The collection previously grew without bound as tokens rotated hourly, which made it easy to revoke a token a live agent was actually using; rotation now cleans up its own dead predecessors at the source.

## [2.12.12] - 2026-06-15

### fixed

- **Windows Defender no longer disables temperature monitoring on some machines.** The driver Owlette uses to read CPU/GPU temperatures is written to disk at runtime, and on some Windows 11 machines Microsoft Defender quarantined that driver file (flagged as `WinRing0`) because the installer's antivirus exclusion didn't cover its actual location. The installer now excludes the driver file itself, so temperatures keep working; existing machines pick up the fix on their next update. Temperature reads are also now time-bounded, so a driver that's blocked at the OS level can never stall the agent's startup or heartbeat.

## [2.12.11] - 2026-06-15

### fixed

- **The display "events" tab now shows recent events.** The dashboard query fetched an arbitrary slice of a machine's logs (ordered by document id, which is a random UUID) instead of the newest ones, so on a machine with many logs recent monitor add/remove/drift events silently never appeared while an old one stayed pinned. The feed now filters to display events and orders by time, so the latest events always show.
- **Auto-restore no longer gets permanently paused when a monitor is turned off.** Powering off (or sleeping / disconnecting) a monitor that's part of a stored layout made auto-restore repeatedly try to re-apply, fail because the monitor isn't present, and trip its circuit breaker after three attempts — leaving auto-restore paused until a manual reset even after the monitor came back. Auto-restore now skips the re-apply while an assigned monitor is absent and resumes on its own when it returns; a transient power-off no longer counts as a failure.

## [2.12.10] - 2026-06-14

### fixed

- **Agent pairing no longer stalls behind an unanswered prompt.** During interactive install the agent used to block on an `open browser? [y/N]` prompt *before* it started polling for authorization — so approving from the dashboard or another device did nothing until that prompt was answered, and pairing could silently time out. The agent now opens the pairing page automatically and starts polling immediately; authorization from any device completes pairing on its own.

### added

- **`--no-browser` pairing option** (and the `OWLETTE_NO_BROWSER=1` env var) skips opening a local browser on kiosks, signage, media servers, and headless or RDP machines while still polling immediately — authorize from your phone or another computer.

## [2.12.9] - 2026-06-09

### fixed

- **Distribution management is now capability-gated end-to-end.** `roost` deploy / rollback / versions / resync / delete and chunk upload-url routes now require the distribution-manage capability; they were previously reachable by read-only site members.
- **Soft-deleted users are blocked across the control plane.** A shared active-user guard now rejects tombstoned users on control-plane and self-service credential routes, and the delete cascade clears site membership and revokes passkeys + MFA.
- **Alert emails no longer send to soft-deleted users.**
- **Agent `cancel_sync` is honored during the sync setup window.** Cancels that arrived before the active sync handler was ready were previously dropped.
- **Agent command dispatch now keys rate limits per target.** A dropped duplicate command is surfaced as failed instead of silently completed.
- **Machine removal now revokes the agent refresh token** so a removed machine cannot keep reporting with an existing refresh session.
- **roost rollback now re-dispatches to machines** instead of only flipping the version pointer.
- **The one-click unsubscribe link disables all alert categories**, not just health alerts.
- **Firestore rules block cross-tenant autonomous Cortex conversation forgery.**

## [2.12.8] - 2026-06-07

### added

- **`/for-ai` page** with `/llms.txt`, `/for-ai.json`, and structured data — an honest, machine-readable pitch to AI assistants evaluating owlette.
- **tridant brand mark** and restructured landing footer ("a tridant system").
- **Site members can view screenshots and live view.** Screenshot / live-view are now authorized by a new read-class `MACHINE_VIEW` capability (granted to members on their assigned sites) rather than the mutating `MACHINE_EXEC_COMMAND`. The machine-commands route dispatches the three view-only command types (`capture_screenshot` / `start_live_view` / `stop_live_view`) to a `MACHINE_VIEW`-gated handler; all other commands stay behind `MACHINE_EXEC_COMMAND`, and api-key scope is unchanged.
- **Cortex tier-3 tool-approval gate.** Tier-3 tool calls now require explicit in-chat approval. `/api/cortex` migrated to the UIMessage protocol (`convertToModelMessages`); the per-site approval flag is default-on and forces the server-side path. Includes Cortex sidebar/UX fixes and a persistent chat layout.
- **Scoped full-text search on the logs page**, plus an animated filters panel.
- **Date-scoped log clearing.** Clear-logs deletion accepts a `since`/`until` range, with the date window computed in the display timezone.
- **Themed date picker** (shadcn calendar + popover input) and dark-mode theming of native form controls via `color-scheme`.
- **Site admins can remove machines on their assigned sites** (previously superadmin-only).
- **Admin user management: last-seen column and deleted-user visibility.**
- **Any authenticated user can create API keys from account settings** — the account dialog was wrongly pointed at the superadmin-only `/api/account/api-keys`; it now uses the user-scoped `/api/keys` with an explicit scope-preset selector.
- **`GET /api/users/deletions`** is now documented in the OpenAPI spec; new Firestore composite indexes back the log filter combinations and the deletions audit feed.
- **CLI / SDK OIDC trusted-publishing workflows** for `@owlette/cli` and the SDKs.

### fixed

- **False "machines offline" emails during scheduled reboots are fixed.** The health-check cron is now reboot-aware: it suppresses offline alerts while a machine is inside an announced reboot/shutdown window — gated on the agent's `rebooting`/`shuttingDown` flag plus the scheduled instant within a bounded ±15-minute grace, so neither a clock-skewed far-future anchor nor a stale anchor left behind by a cancel can mute a real outage — and it debounces transient staleness (`health.staleSince`) so a single missed 120-second heartbeat never pages. Agent-side, the periodic heartbeat (`_upload_metrics`) no longer reports connection success when its Firestore write fails — which had left a machine `online: true` with a frozen `lastHeartbeat` and no reconnect — and cancelling a scheduled reboot/shutdown now also clears `shutdownScheduledAt` (it had kept the dashboard countdown pill alive).
- **Dashboard no longer shows members process write-controls they can't use.** The per-process launch-mode toggle and the edit / restart / kill / add-process actions were rendered to every viewer in both the card and list views, so a member would click them and get a 403. They're now gated on `isSiteAdmin`: non-admins see the current launch mode as a read-only pill, and the write actions are hidden.
- **Expected authorization failures are no longer reported to Sentry as errors.** A member's launch-mode 403 was logged via `logger.firestore.error` → `Sentry.captureMessage(level: error)`, polluting error tracking with an expected outcome. `apiJson` now carries the HTTP status and `setLaunchMode` treats 401/403 as an expected denial (surfaced to the user as a toast, not a Sentry error).
- **Dashboard "Missing or insufficient permissions" error (Sentry OWLETTE-WEB-3R).** `useUserManagement` opened a realtime listener over the whole `users` collection (superadmin-only per `firestore.rules`) for *every* user, via `ManageSitesDialog` mounted on the dashboard/roosts/logs/deployments pages — so every non-superadmin tripped a permission-denied on load. The listener is now gated to superadmins (client-side; rules unchanged).
- **Quieted expected `permission-denied` noise** on the site-availability check (`CreateSiteDialog`) and Cortex chat-URL load, and **blocked agent ID tokens from minting user API keys** (`POST /api/keys`).
- **Logs are ordered by timestamp across all filter combinations.**
- **roost:** config-only republish honors content-addressed CAS on the no-op branch; a restated deploy config is applied on same-version republish.
- **Cortex conversation rows are a11y-accessible** (no nested buttons).
- **Dark-mode button hover repaired** and standardized on the secondary rollover.
- **Metrics panel** persistence restored (gated on a non-empty selection; no auto-restore on load); empty metrics-slide gap removed; inline sparklines read hourly `metrics_history` buckets; disk r/w throughput right-aligned in the machine list.

### changed

- **Logs page refactor** — themed date pickers, date-scoped clear, aligned-column table.
- **Sunken machine card/list surfaces** with section enclosures; metrics/displays panels darkened with brighter content.
- **CLI pre-publish hardening** (6-wave review): request timeouts, idempotency-key surfacing on unconfirmed failures; `owlette key` removed (key management is dashboard-only).
- Removed the dead `MachineListView` wrapper and redundant per-instance button hover overrides.

### infrastructure / docs

- `/preflight` pre-push gate + `post-push-e2e` watch hook; build-system skill expanded with the installer-release + version-bump flow.
- CI: bumped checkout/setup-node/setup-java/cache to Node 24 action majors; py-sdk publish now runs pytest first.
- Layperson video-tutorial series + Playwright video-capture harness.

## [2.12.7] - 2026-06-02

### fixed

- **Scheduled restarts were silently skipped for ~30 minutes after any boot.** The reboot scheduler refused to fire *any* entry while machine uptime was under 30 minutes, and a separate 30-minute "manual-reboot grace" counted a recent boot as already satisfying an upcoming entry. Together these blocked legitimate short-interval / back-to-back scheduled restarts — a restart scheduled shortly after a boot would never fire. Both guards are removed. Reboot loops are still prevented structurally: the per-entry, per-day `lastFiredByEntry` dedup means each entry fires at most once per local day, the stale-attempt handler clears interrupted attempts, and the 5-minute missed-fire grace is retained.
- **An already-paired agent could not be switched between dev and prod via the installer.** Two causes: (1) `configure_site._determine_environment` consulted the existing config *before* the explicit `--url` and hard-returned `development` whenever the current env was dev, so a dev-paired agent re-run with `--url https://owlette.app/api` was silently re-locked to dev (asymmetric — prod→dev worked, dev→prod did not); (2) the installer's `ShouldConfigureSite` skipped pairing entirely whenever a valid config existed, ignoring `/SERVER` and `/ADD`. Now an explicit `--url` wins, and the installer re-runs pairing when `/ADD=` is supplied or `/SERVER=` names a different environment than the config is bound to. Also tightened: an empty `site_id` no longer counts as "paired", and an explicit `/SERVER=` against a config with no recognizable `environment` field re-pairs rather than silently skipping.
- **A stale Firestore/cache config could clobber the local dev/prod routing selection.** Firestore config sync preserved the `firebase` section but not the top-level `environment` field, so a config doc seeded while a machine was on one environment could, after a server switch, leave `config.json` with a prod `firebase` section but a dev top-level `environment` — split-brain routing (the Firebase client talks to prod while `get_api_base_url()` routes to dev). `environment` is now treated as local-only during sync, alongside `firebase`/`sentry`.

### changed

- **Installer docs corrected: production is the default when `/SERVER` is omitted.** The installer header comment and `INSTALLER-USAGE.md` stated dev was the default; the code has always defaulted to prod (`{param:SERVER|prod}`).

## [2.12.6] - 2026-05-31

### fixed

- **Exiting owlette and relaunching the tray left the machine offline behind a flashing red tray icon.** The tray's *exit* action issues a controlled `net stop OwletteService`, which NSSM intentionally does not auto-restart. Relaunching from the Start-menu "Owlette" shortcut started only the tray — not the service — so monitoring stayed down (the machine showed offline in the dashboard) and the tray flashed its red "Service: Stopped" alarm with no way to recover from the shortcut. Now, when owlette is **explicitly relaunched to resume it** (the Start-menu "Owlette" shortcut passes `--resume`), the tray starts the stopped service with a single UAC prompt, so clicking "Owlette" actually brings owlette back. The start is deliberately *not* triggered on the passive launch paths — the service launching the tray itself, or the startup-folder shortcut firing at login before the delayed-auto service has started — so it never pops an unwanted UAC prompt at boot. A disabled service (start-on-login turned off) is detected and the futile prompt skipped.
- **Tray "restart" did nothing when the service was fully stopped — and took the tray down with it.** "Restart" wrote a restart flag for the *running* service to detect and exit-42 on (so NSSM respawns it), then stopped the tray. With the service already stopped there was no service loop to read the flag, so nothing restarted and the user lost the tray as well. It now detects the stopped state and starts the service directly, leaving the tray running.
- **Tray log spammed the "service status file is stale" warning twice a second.** `read_service_status()` is called more than once per monitor cycle (status check + menu refresh) and logged on every stale read, doubling each line and bloating `tray.log`. The warning now logs once when the file goes stale and once when it recovers.
- **Cortex tier-2 process control was silently doing nothing (OWL-03).** `_handle_cortex_process_command` passed the process-config dict to `graceful_terminate()`, which expects a PID — raising a `TypeError` that a broad `except` swallowed. Every Cortex tier-2 kill / restart / start (and autonomous self-healing) failed without surfacing an error. It now resolves the running PID and mirrors the proven dashboard kill/restart paths; covered by a regression test.
- **`cancel_sync` can now interrupt an active roost sync (OWL-06).** It previously sat behind the running sync in the normal command lane; it is now routed to the fast lane so a cancel is processed promptly.
- **Logging can no longer crash on non-ASCII content on Windows.** The log file handler is opened utf-8 with `errors='backslashreplace'`, so a non-ASCII character (e.g. the `→` used in several status messages) can't raise `UnicodeEncodeError` under the cp1252 default and take down logging.

### changed

- **Installer: consolidated the Start-menu tray shortcut.** Upgrades now remove the stale "Owlette Tray Icon" shortcut left by older versions; the single click-to-launch/resume entry is "Owlette". The in-session startup auto-launch is retained.

## [2.12.5] - 2026-05-28

### fixed

- **Installer "DeleteFile failed: code 5" when upgrading with the GUI/tray/service running.** The locked file was `C:\ProgramData\Owlette\python\libcrypto-3.dll` (OpenSSL — loaded by every Owlette Python process). The pre-existing kill logic in `InitializeSetup()` filtered processes by `.Path -like '*\Owlette\*'`, but `Get-Process.Path` returns `$null` for processes the elevated installer can't introspect (integrity-level restrictions), so those slipped through silently; the fixed 5 s sleep also wasn't long enough when AV scanners held the libcrypto handle after process exit. Three hardening passes (verified via 4-agent codex review):
  1. **Service-state verification after `net stop`.** Without it, a `net stop` timeout left NSSM alive — and NSSM's `AppExit=Default Restart` policy respawned the python child immediately after the kill pass terminated it, re-locking libcrypto-3.dll mid-copy. The installer now checks `Get-Service OwletteService` reports `Stopped` before proceeding, and aborts cleanly otherwise. `ServiceWasStopped` is gated on this verify.
  2. **Second kill pass by loaded modules.** Catches processes whose `.Path` is unreadable or whose exe lives outside Owlette but loaded an Owlette `.pyd`/`.dll`.
  3. **Poll libcrypto-3.dll for exclusive-write availability** (up to 30 s, 250 ms retry) instead of a fixed `Sleep(5000)`. If still locked at 30 s, the installer aborts with a clear "please reboot" message rather than failing mid-copy. Service-restart on abort delegated to the existing `DeinitializeSetup` to avoid double-restart.

## [2.12.4] - 2026-05-27

### fixed

- **Agent `/ADD=` silent-install pairing (dashboard "generate code") could never connect — every Firestore call returned 403.** A dashboard-generated pairing code minted the agent token at *authorize* time with a placeholder `machine_id` claim (`pending_<phrase>`), because the target hostname is unknown when the code is generated. The installed agent uses its real hostname for every Firestore document path, and `firestore.rules` `agentCanAccessMachine` requires an exact `machine_id` match — so every machine-scoped read/write was denied. (The browser and "enter code" pairing flows were unaffected; they carry the real hostname before authorize runs.) Token minting is now **deferred to poll time**: `authorize` records only the admin-authorized site (`deferTokenMint`), and the agent's `/ADD=` poll supplies its real `machineId`, which the server binds into the token via a single-use claim-lease (mint outside the transaction, atomic delete + refresh-token write on finalize). The agent machine-id is also unified on `shared_utils.get_hostname()` across `AuthManager` and `FirebaseClient` so the poll value cannot diverge from the Firestore path identity. Requires the matching web deploy; machines already paired via `/ADD=` must re-pair.

## [2.12.3] - 2026-05-19

### fixed

- **Agent screenshot capture restored — properly this time.** 2.12.2 fixed the broken signed-URL flow by routing the `capture_screenshot` command back through the pre-refactor `OwletteService._handle_capture_screenshot` path (base64 upload via `/api/agent/screenshot`). That was working but architecturally wrong — Next.js was proxying multi-MB image bodies again, and `screenshot_capture.py` was effectively dead code despite being the api-sprint's intended replacement. 2.12.3 restores the signed-URL design end-to-end with the missing pieces actually built:
  1. **User-session capture moved into `screenshot_capture.py`.** The Windows service runs as LocalSystem in Session 0; mss inside Session 0 captures a blank ~2 KB LocalSystem display. The pre-refactor working flow ran capture inside the active user's desktop session via `CreateProcessAsUser`. That mechanism (`OwletteService.execute_in_user_session` → `session_exec.py`) is now wired into `screenshot_capture.capture_in_user_session()` via dependency injection — the service passes its `execute_in_user_session` method to `capture_and_upload`, the user-session interpreter runs `mss` + `PIL` (JPEG quality 72, max-width 7680 px, PNG fallback if PIL is missing), and writes the bytes into the IPC output directory.
  2. **`OwletteService.execute_in_user_session` now returns `outputDir` in its result envelope** so callers can read files directly without scanning `ipc/results/` for the most-recent screenshot (which was the OLD pattern and is racy under concurrent captures).
  3. **New `POST /api/sites/{siteId}/machines/{machineId}/screenshots/finalize` endpoint.** After the signed-URL PUT lands, the agent calls finalize with the `storagePath` + `sizeKB`. Server-side: verifies the object exists, pins content-type metadata, makes the file public-read, writes `sites/{siteId}/machines/{machineId}.lastScreenshot = { url, timestamp, sizeKB }` (the Firestore field the dashboard's ScreenshotDialog subscribes to in real-time), appends a `screenshots/{docId}` history doc, and prunes to the most-recent 20. Same `lastScreenshot` field + history pruning behavior as the legacy `/api/agent/screenshot` route, but for the signed-URL upload path.
  4. **Path → content-type alignment.** Storage paths now use `.jpg` for JPEG bodies and `.png` for PNG fallback, so the URL doesn't lie about its content.
  5. **`machine_commands._handle_capture_screenshot` reverted** from the 2.12.2 delegation to the proper `capture_and_upload(executor=service.execute_in_user_session, ...)` call. The temp delegation path in OwletteService is no longer invoked by the public API (kept in source for now to keep the diff focused; can be removed in a follow-up cleanup pass).

  Net result: multi-MB image bodies no longer transit Next.js, dashboard `lastScreenshot` updates immediately via Firestore real-time (no polling), and the signed-URL upload concept ships end-to-end as originally designed by the api-sprint (3027713).

- **Login page hydration fixed (React #418).** The passkey button rendered via `{browserSupportsWebAuthn() && …}` evaluated during render — the server (no `window`) omitted the button, the client included it: a hydration mismatch. It looked harmless (React recovers by discarding the SSR tree and re-rendering client-side) but it threw away `/login`'s server HTML on every load, and in the Playwright E2E harness the in-flight re-render dropped the login click so the suite hung on `/login`. This is why E2E had been red since the 2.12.0 hardening pass — that pass switched the root layout to dynamic rendering (`await headers()` for the CSP nonce), which surfaced the latent mismatch as a thrown error in production builds. Fixed by gating the button on a `mounted` flag: server + first client render agree (no button), button revealed after hydration via `useEffect`. E2E is green again.

- **Alert emails localize timestamps to the machine's IANA timezone.** The alert-email renderer passed a Windows-style zone string ("Pacific Standard Time") to `toLocaleString`, which only accepts IANA names ("America/Los_Angeles") — so every alert email threw `RangeError: Invalid time zone specified` and silently failed to send. Now uses the machine's stored IANA timezone.

### added

- **owlette.app failover origin — Cloudflare Load Balancing (Railway primary, Vercel standby).** Groundwork for surviving a single-provider outage (the failure mode that took prod down on 2026-05-19 when Google Cloud blocked Railway's account):
  - **`GET /api/health`** — unauthenticated readiness probe (shallow Firestore read, 2.5 s timeout, 200/503) so the load balancer can fail an origin out when it's up but can't reach its backend (the exact "provider lost cloud egress" mode).
  - **`infra/cloudflare/`** — Terraform module for the load balancer: Railway primary pool + Vercel fallback pool, `/api/health` monitor, and `adaptive_routing { failover_across_pools = true }` for an instant mid-request cross-pool handoff instead of waiting ~60 s for the next health-check cycle. Apply workflow + token scope + origin-hostname gotchas documented in `.claude/skills/cf-load-balancing.md`.
  - **`scripts/sync-env.mjs` + `scripts/env-manifest.json`** — manifest-driven env-var management across railway-dev / railway-prod / vercel-prod (status / check / diff / sync; values never printed; dry-run by default). Workflow + must-match secret rules in `.claude/skills/env-management.md`.
  - **Vercel deploy wiring** — `web/vercel.json` removed (the auto-generated `experimentalServices` config put the project in the wrong framework mode); `.vercelignore` + `web/.npmrc` added for a correct monorepo deploy.

  This is groundwork: the load balancer and Vercel deploy aren't live yet, so `/api/health` ships and sits inert until failover is provisioned.

## [2.12.2] - 2026-05-19 [superseded by 2.12.3]

> The screenshot fix in 2.12.2 used a temporary delegation to the
> pre-refactor base64 upload path. 2.12.3 replaces that with the
> proper signed-URL pipeline. The other 2.12.2 fixes (audit-export
> guard, TimezoneChip, CSP) shipped unchanged through 2.12.3.

### fixed

- **Agent screenshot capture restored (interim).** Two regressions from the api-sprint refactor (`3027713`, 2026-04-26) silently broke capture for ~3 weeks:
  1. `/api/sites/{siteId}/machines/{machineId}/screenshots/upload-url` 404'd every agent call with `"site not found or no access"`. The new `requireMachineAuthAndScope` helper had no agent-token short-circuit, so agent IDs fell through to a `users/{uid}.sites[]` lookup — a doc agents don't have. Fixed by mirroring the agent-token branch from the sibling `requireAgentOrSiteAuthAndScope` (with a defense-in-depth check that the token's `machine_id` matches the URL path).
  2. The new `screenshot_capture.capture_and_upload` flow ran `mss` directly in the service process. The agent service runs as LocalSystem in Session 0, so mss captured a blank ~2 KB LocalSystem display instead of the actual user desktop. The pre-refactor path ran capture inside the active user's session via `CreateProcessAsUser` and uploaded via `/api/agent/screenshot` (which also writes the `lastScreenshot` Firestore field the dashboard listens on); the new path skipped both. `machine_commands._handle_capture_screenshot` was temporarily routed back through that pre-refactor path; 2.12.3 supersedes with the proper signed-URL design.

- **Audit-export Cloud Function deploys cleanly to prod.** `exportSecurityBoundaryAuditDevDaily` referenced a dedicated service account that only exists in the dev project (`security-boundary-audit-export@owlette-dev-3838a`). Cloud Functions Gen 2 validated the SA at deploy time and would reject the prod deploy of all 24 functions in `firebase deploy --only functions`. The serviceAccount config is now conditionally attached only for the dev project, and the function body early-returns with a log message outside dev. (Provisioning the prod SA + bucket + IAM is a follow-up; this lets the rest of the release ship.)

- **TimezoneChip shows abbreviation, not city name.** `tz.split('/').pop()` rendered "Los Angeles" / "New York" / "Berlin" — which read more like a city than a timezone. `Intl.DateTimeFormat({ timeZoneName: 'short' })` is observance-aware and returns `PDT` / `PST` / `EDT` automatically. Zones without a stable abbreviation fall back to `GMT±N`. Chip font also reduced one step (the screenshot-dialog history sidebar where this is most visible was too prominent).

- **Login page no longer fails to hydrate under the 2.12.0 CSP.** The hardening pass set `style-src` and `style-src-elem` to `'self' 'nonce-...'`, but Next 16 emits inline `<style>` blocks during client-side hydration/navigation that the request-header nonce only covers for scripts. The browser blocked those styles, the page hit a React #418 hydration mismatch, and the login form became inert (Playwright E2E suite caught the regression on every push). Both directives now use `'self' 'unsafe-inline'` — modern browsers ignore `'unsafe-inline'` when a nonce is present, so the style nonce was dropped intentionally. Script injection remains nonce + strict-dynamic locked; style injection is materially lower risk.

### infrastructure

- **`functions/.gitignore` tightened.** Now blocks all `.env*` overlays (e.g. `.env.owlette-prod-90a12`) except the committed `.env.example` template, preventing prod secrets from being accidentally tracked.

## [2.12.1] - 2026-05-18

### fixed

- **Display layout no longer flags healthy monitors as "not connected" after RDP / virtual-display events.** Two changes:
  1. The `edidHash` payload no longer includes the Windows-reported monitor friendly name. Windows reports that string inconsistently across driver state transitions (RDP attach/detach, monitor sleep, EDID re-read fallback), so the same physical panel was receiving different hashes between snapshots — which surfaced as every stored monitor showing "⚠ not connected" after a remote session, along with spurious `display_drift` / `display_monitor_added` / `display_monitor_removed` events. The hash is now identity-only: `manufacturer | productCode | device-path serial`.
  2. Indirect display drivers (Miracast, IddCx-based indirect displays, the RDP `RdpIdd_IndirectDisplay` / "Microsoft Remote Display Adapter", dummy-plug EDIDs like `HDP-V104`) are now skipped at CCD enumeration. These appear and disappear with remote sessions and previously polluted the topology signature, the drift counter, and the events feed every time someone attached. Only physical output technologies (DVI, HDMI, DP, USB-C tunnel, internal, etc.) are enumerated.

  Existing assigned layouts stored under the old hashing scheme are re-derived on read on both the agent and web sides — no manual migration required, no need to re-press "store" after upgrading.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-05-17

### security

- **Five unauthenticated Cloud Functions hardened**: `emitWebhook`, `recordAuditEvent`, `verifyAuditChain`, `preUploadCheck`, `recordUsageEvent` all now require an `x-internal-secret` header matching `CORTEX_INTERNAL_SECRET`. Previously these `onRequest` functions defaulted to `invoker: 'public'` and could be called by anyone with the project ID, allowing webhook forgery (signed events to customer subscribers), audit-log injection, quota DoS, and billing-data poisoning. Shared helper `functions/src/lib/requireInternalSecret.ts` uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` for constant-time comparison.
- **MFA is now server-enforced.** Previously MFA enforcement lived in browser sessionStorage + a client-side `router.push('/verify-2fa')` that could be bypassed by navigating directly to `/dashboard`. Iron-session `SessionData` now carries `mfaRequired` + `mfaVerified` flags baked at session-create time from `users/{uid}.mfaEnrolled`. The proxy gates protected paths when `mfaRequired && !mfaVerified` and redirects to `/verify-2fa`. Successful TOTP / backup-code / MFA-setup flips `mfaVerified` server-side. Pre-deploy sessions are upgraded lazily on first protected-page hit. New `/api/mfa/disable` route is the only way to disable MFA — requires current TOTP or backup code, writes audit log, re-mints the session.
- **Firestore rules tightened to block client-side privilege escalation.** User-doc create rule now constrains `sites[]` to `[]`, `email` to the auth token email, `mfaEnrolled`/`passkeyEnrolled` to `false`, `requiresMfaSetup` to `true`. User-doc update switched from value-equality checks to a `diff().affectedKeys().hasOnly([allowlist])` policy — sensitive fields (role/email/sites/MFA state) must go through trusted server routes. `canAccessSite()` and `isSiteOwner()` now check `users/{uid}.deletedAt` so admin-soft-deleted users immediately lose dashboard access. Rules version bumped to 2.5.0.
- **Three new rule blocks plug agent silent-failure paths**: `sites/{s}/machines/{m}/cortex/{docId}` (local Cortex active-chat state), `sites/{s}/machines/{m}/logs/{logId}` (per-machine log shipping), and `sites/{s}/cortex-events/{eventId}` (autonomous-event log) now have explicit rules matching `agentCanAccessMachine()` / `isAgent() && site_id`. Previously these writes fell to the deny-all fallback and the entire local-Cortex feature was silently broken end-to-end.
- **API key revocation now actually revokes.** `apiAuth.server.ts` now checks `revokedAt` before retiresAt/expiresAt. Previously the admin "revoke key" button and the user-delete cascade's revocation were no-ops.
- **Legacy unscoped API keys rejected by default.** Pre-scope-system keys with empty/missing `scopes` arrays now fail authentication unless explicitly opted in via `LEGACY_API_KEY_BYPASS_ENABLED=true` + `LEGACY_API_KEY_ALLOW_HASH_LIST`, and even allowlisted legacy keys can't pass `requireScope()` (they resolve to `scopes: []`).
- **Cross-machine token isolation** on `/api/agent/screenshot` and `/api/agent/alert`. Routes now verify `decodedToken.machine_id === machineId` (not just `site_id`), preventing a compromised agent token for machine A from spoofing reports for machine B in the same site.
- **Webhook delivery pipeline reconciled.** Cloud Functions dispatcher was reading `collectionGroup('webhook_subscriptions')` while the web API was writing `sites/{siteId}/webhooks/{id}` — async roost-event webhook delivery emitted zero deliveries. Now both ends use the `webhooks` collection.
- **Passkey login now requires user verification** (`userVerification: 'required'`, previously `'preferred'`). Single-touch FIDO keys without PIN/biometric no longer suffice for full account access.
- **Backup code single-use guaranteed.** Backup-code verification in `/api/mfa/verify-login` now runs inside a Firestore transaction that re-reads the array before removing the matching code, preventing two concurrent same-code requests from both passing.
- **Agent refresh tokens rotate on every refresh.** `/api/agent/auth/refresh` now generates a new refresh token, marks the old one superseded with a 5-minute grace window, and returns the new token to the agent. Captured tokens no longer grant indefinite access. Agents receive the new `refreshToken` in the response and must persist it on every refresh.
- **Roost kill switch is now wired into web API routes** (17 `/api/roosts/*` + `/api/chunks/*` handlers). Flipping `sites/{siteId}.roostEnabled=false` now actually halts uploads, not just agent sync work.
- **Account self-deletion no longer wipes shared sites.** Previously the cascade hard-deleted every site in the user's `sites[]` array including sites where the user was just a member — wiping out the entire site for the owner. Now classified per-site: sole-owner sites are hard-deleted (existing behavior); shared owned sites refuse with `409 needs_successor`; member sites have only `arrayRemove(uid)`. Cascade also drains previously-missed subcollections (`passkeys`, `api_keys`, top-level `api_keys/{hash}` lookups, `mfa_pending`, `agent_refresh_tokens`, `chats`, Firebase Storage avatar) and revokes + deletes the Firebase Auth user server-side rather than relying on the client.
- **Admin soft-delete also revokes Firebase Auth tokens.** Previously `deletedAt` was written on the user doc but Firebase Auth was untouched; the user could keep using their session until the ID token expired. Now the admin cascade calls `revokeRefreshTokens` + `updateUser({disabled: true})` immediately.
- **`x-owlette-security-version` header bumped to 2** so dashboard tabs open at deploy time will surface a reload nudge.
- **LLM cost endpoints rate-limited.** `/api/cortex/categorize` and `/api/cortex/provision-key` are now wrapped in `withRateLimit({strategy: 'user'})` so a captured session cookie can't burn through LLM credits.
- **Unsafe role fallback removed.** `cortex-utils.server.ts` previously defaulted unknown roles to `'admin'` (site-scoped privileged); now defaults to `'member'` (least-privileged).
- **`/api/agent/alert` localhost fallback fixed.** When `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is unset, autonomous-Cortex callbacks now fall back to `https://owlette.app` (matching the email-templates pattern) instead of `http://localhost:${PORT}`.

### changed

- **Cloud Functions reconcilers now exported.** `reconcileDeploymentStatus` and `reconcileDistributionStatus` were defined but missing from `functions/src/index.ts`. With the rules lockdown live, deployment/distribution status writes would have been silently dropped. Both are now exported and deploy.
- **Scheduled-function batch sizes capped at 400.** `chunkGc.tombstoneStore.create` and `aggregateTelemetry.trimOlderThan` previously committed all matched docs in a single batch, which fails past Firestore's 500-op limit. Now chunked.
- **`apiKeyExpire` query bounded.** Added `.where('expiredMarkedAt', '==', null)` filter so the daily scan doesn't grow linearly with historical expired-key count.
- **Rate limiter `setInterval` no longer leaks Jest workers.** `web/lib/rateLimit.ts` cleanup timer now calls `.unref()` so test processes exit cleanly.

### added

- New composite Firestore index `webhook_deliveries(state, nextAttemptAt)` for the retry-queue pump.
- New composite Firestore index `api_keys(expiresAt, expiredMarkedAt)` for the bounded `apiKeyExpire` query.
- One-shot deprecation warnings for legacy API keys with empty scopes and for API keys passed via query string. Both log a keyHash prefix once per process so operators can identify which integrations need to migrate.

### required env vars (new)

- `CORTEX_INTERNAL_SECRET` — must be set on Cloud Functions (in `functions/.env`) for the 5 internal-only HTTPS functions to operate. Without it, all 5 return 503.
- Optional `LEGACY_API_KEY_BYPASS_ENABLED` + `LEGACY_API_KEY_ALLOW_HASH_LIST` — emergency-only allowlist for legacy unscoped keys during the migration window.

### migration notes

- **Agents on 2.11.x and earlier**: still compatible. Refresh tokens are issued under the new rotation scheme on next `/api/agent/auth/refresh` call; older tokens stay valid until first refresh.
- **CLI clients on 1.0.0-rc and earlier**: still compatible. No CLI behavior changes in 2.12.0.
- **Pre-deploy iron-session cookies**: lazily upgraded on first protected-page hit (one Firestore read per cookie). After the upgrade the cookie carries the new MFA flags. Cookies expire naturally within 7 days.

## [2.11.3] - 2026-05-08

### added

- New Cortex Tier 2 tools `update_process`, `add_process`, and `delete_process` bring the chat to feature parity with the GUI/web for process management. The tools accept the full set of process config fields (name, exe_path, file_path, cwd, priority, visibility, time_delay, time_to_init, relaunch_attempts, launch_mode, schedules, schedulePresetId) and execute server-side via the existing validated action functions — no agent relay, no command-queue latency.
- Agent now surfaces missing-executable failures as dashboard toast notifications with up to two suggested alternative paths (sibling versions discovered by walking up from the missing path). The toast offers a one-click "use path" action that opens the process edit dialog with the suggested path pre-filled.
- New canonical `firebase_client.send_alert(event_type, data)` method with retry-on-failure queueing (drains on reconnect, capped at 100 pending alerts). The previous `send_process_alert` and `send_display_alert` are now thin wrappers that delegate to it.

### changed

- `/api/agent/alert` route now accepts both the new generic `{eventType, data}` shape and the legacy flat process-alert shape, so older agent callers keep working unchanged while new event types (`exe_missing`, etc.) flow through cleanly.

### fixed

- Missing-executable failures (e.g. when a process's configured `exe_path` no longer exists after an app upgrade) are now surfaced to the operator instead of silently failing every tick. Previously the agent only logged the error to its local log file, leaving operators with no signal that a managed process couldn't launch. Rate-limited so it fires once per failed-state transition, not every 5-second main-loop tick.

## [2.11.2] - 2026-05-06

### fixed

- Agent GUI process-details panel now stays in sync with external `launch_mode` changes. The dropdown and schedule label refresh immediately even while a text entry is focused; entry-field updates are deferred and retried after focus leaves so Firestore changes are no longer permanently dropped.
- GUI `launch_mode` changes no longer trigger a brief command-prompt flash. `GPUtil.getGPUs()` (called transitively from the GUI's post-toggle metrics push) now spawns `nvidia-smi` with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` via a Windows-only monkey-patch in `shared_utils._get_gputil()`.
- `launch_mode` transitions originating from the GUI now run the same runtime cleanup as web-originated changes. The service maintains an in-memory snapshot of last-applied modes and diffs it on every main-loop tick, applying transitions through a single `_apply_launch_mode_transition` helper. Previously the GUI flow bypassed the smart-transition path because it wrote disk before uploading to Firestore, leaving stuck `killed`/cooldown markers that prevented relaunch.
- `off → scheduled` transitions outside the schedule window now clear stale runtime markers on the transition itself, so a previously-killed process will launch when the schedule window next opens (was stuck before).
- Cortex `set_launch_mode` IPC handler called `shared_utils.write_config(config)` with the wrong signature, so launch-mode changes from Cortex were silently not persisted. Now uses `save_config(config)`.
- Cortex chat tool calls for `set_launch_mode` (and other Tier 2 tools dispatched through `executeExistingCommand`) now forward all LLM-supplied parameters — `mode`, `schedules`, `schedulePresetId`, etc. — to the agent. Previously only `process_name` was forwarded, so the agent's command handler defaulted `mode` to `off` regardless of what the user asked for.

### changed

- Firebase `set_launch_mode` / `toggle_autolaunch` command handler now matches by `process_id` first with a `process_name` fallback, making it robust to processes with duplicate names.

### added - post-2.11 updates

- Site-tier billing now gates beta sites as `core` or `pro`, defaulting beta sites to `pro`.
- Process control now includes `restart_process` end to end across the public API, CLI, and agent control surfaces.
- Agent GUI `kill_process` actions now require a confirmation dialog before dispatch.

### changed - post-2.11 updates

- Landing and pricing pages were refreshed across the redesign, use-case, developer, proof, pricing, and GPU-label sections.
- roost and webhooks UI surfaces are now labeled as developer preview.

### fixed - post-2.11 updates

- Metrics charts refresh their time window when a dashboard tab regains focus.
- Streaming API responses no longer enter the idempotency cache.
- Status page readiness checks are hardened against partial service readiness.

### security - post-2.11 updates

- Remote installer requests now require a SHA-256 checksum before an agent accepts the installer.
- `getUsageSummaryHttp` now requires site-scoped auth before returning usage data.
- Site-member and project-distribution routes now enforce their capability gates before mutations.
- Chat routes now enforce conversation ownership before returning or mutating conversations.

### added - security-boundary migration prep

Adds the production-readiness material for the security-boundary migration: W8.2 observability, W9.0 operator runbooks, customer communication draft, and scheduled audit-export plan.

**admin impact**: expected to be no user-visible change for admins and superadmins. Control-plane writes now stay server-mediated through scoped REST routes, capability checks, rate limits, and blocking audit writes; existing dashboard workflows should keep the same behavior.

**member impact**: milestone A intentionally keeps direct member control-plane command capability denied after rules lockdown. Members may continue read-only and explicitly allowed flows, but machine commands and other privileged control-plane writes remain admin/superadmin-only until the configurable policy work lands in milestone B.

**operations**: both enforcement switches are documented (`capability_enforcement`, `rate_limit_enforcement`), including when to flip them, the 4-hour incident window, audit implications, alert wiring, and re-enable checklist. The incident playbook covers capability denial spikes, Cortex system-bucket 429s, and account-deletion cascade recovery.

**audit retention**: security-boundary audit rows under `sites/*/audit_log` and platform rows under `global/audit_log/entries` now have a GCS managed-export schedule plan with retention longer than the Firestore hot-store window and a restore drill.

### added — api-sprint: 30+ scoped REST endpoints across 6 capability tracks

Promotes the internal admin-gated capabilities (machine commands, processes, classic-installer deploys, agent-installer mgmt, cortex chat, user/member admin) to public, scoped, api-key-friendly REST endpoints. Closes 35 cli stubs in `owlette-cli`. New: full Node + Python SDK coverage. The roost data-plane (chunks/versions/deployments/keys/webhooks) was already public from the prior cycle; this release fills out the rest of the platform surface.

**Versioning**: this is **additive** — no breaking changes to existing callers, no removals. Sits in `[Unreleased]` until cut. The 3.0.0 major-bump moment is deferred to `roost-public-api` W8 (public launch) which will combine this surface + the v1-agent compat cutover noted in `project_roost.md`.

**new public endpoints (~30)** — every endpoint accepts `Authorization: Bearer owk_*` (api key) or session/ID-token; mutations require `Idempotency-Key` (24h replay window, body-hash mismatch → 422 `idempotency_key_mismatch`); errors are RFC 7807 problem+json with stable `code` strings; collections are cursor-paginated per AIP-158; every mutation emits a fire-and-forget audit-log event under one of seven `MutationKind` taxonomies.

- **`/api/sites/{siteId}/deployments/*`** — classic installer deploy CRUD + retry/cancel/uninstall/delete (7 verbs). Quota-enforced (max-targets-per-deploy=100, configurable via `sites/{id}.deployQuota`; 413 `over_quota`). Cancel actively purges queued commands so a stale entry can't be picked up. Uninstall requires `site=<id>:admin`.
- **`/api/installer/*`** — agent-installer binary management (list, latest, 3-step upload, set-latest, delete). Superadmin-only (gated by new `requirePlatformAuthAndScope` helper that composes Wave-0 primitives + a defense-in-depth role check). Soft-delete protects the current latest version and enforces min-active-versions ≥ 2.
- **`/api/sites/{siteId}/machines/{machineId}/commands/*`** — dispatch + status-poll for `reboot_machine` / `shutdown_machine` / `capture_screenshot`. Live-view streaming explicitly out of scope (deferred Wave-4 spike). Offline machine returns 409 `machine_offline` (not queued). Screenshot uses a 3-step CLI flow: dispatch → poll → download from 1-hour signed URL.
- **`/api/sites/{siteId}/machines/{machineId}/processes/*`** — full process CRUD + control verbs (kill / restart / start / stop / schedule). 10 verbs total. Race-safe via the new `withProcessLock()` helper — Firestore transaction enforces duplicate-name rejection (409 `duplicate_process_name`) inside the txn boundary; lazy backfill of `processId` UUIDs on legacy rows. Schedule verb writes through the lock (no command queue); the other four control verbs queue commands.
- **`/api/cortex/conversations/*`** — canonical Cortex conversation API (5 verbs: create, list, send+stream, soft-delete, rename). Reuses Cortex's dual-path streaming engine (local agent vs server-side LLM) via the extracted `cortexStream.server.ts` helper. Older `/api/chat/*` routes remain compatibility aliases. Conversations are stored at `chat_conversations/{id}` with embedded messages capped at 200; overflow splits into `chat_messages/{conversationId}/{messageId}` subcollection.
- **`/api/users/*`** — platform user administration (7 verbs: list/get/promote/demote/assign-sites/remove-sites/delete). Superadmin-gated. Last-superadmin guard runs inside the demote transaction (409 `last_superadmin`). DELETE cascade with explicit failure modes: orphan-sites guard (409 `orphan_sites` if user owns sites and `successorUid` not provided); successor validation; api-key revocation across both subcollection + top-level lookup; background `setImmediate` command-cancel sweep.
- **`/api/sites/{siteId}/members/*`** — site membership (3 verbs: list/add/remove). Site-admin-gated. Add with `role: 'admin'` against a member-tier user returns `roleHonored: false` rather than silently promoting globally — explicit promotion goes through `/api/users/{uid}/promote`.

**owlette CLI** — `@owlette/cli` (binary `owlette`) prepared as v1.0.0-rc.0 with 6 promoted command groups: `chat` (5 verbs), `user` (7), `deploy` (classic installer; 7), `installer` (4), `process` (10), `machine` mutations (3 — reboot/shutdown/screenshot; live-view stays as the only C-tier stub). Plus `whoami`, `version`, `site`, `quota`, `audit-log`, `machine` reads from the prior cli wave. Every mutation auto-generates `Idempotency-Key: cli-<noun>-<verb>-<uuid>`; stable error codes (`machine_offline`, `duplicate_process_name`, `over_quota`, `min_versions_violated`, `last_superadmin`, `orphan_sites`, `scope_insufficient`) get human-readable hints; destructive verbs honor `--yes`.

**Node + Python SDKs** — extended to the 1.0.0 RC package line: `@owlette/sdk@1.0.0-rc.1` and `owlette-sdk==1.0.0rc0` (PEP 440 spelling). Both add 6 new resource modules (`installerDeployments`/`installer_deployments`, `installer`, `processes`, `chat`, `users`, `members`) plus extension of `machines` with command-dispatch + screenshot orchestration (queue → poll → download). Both auto-generate `Idempotency-Key: sdk-<resource>-<verb>-<uuid>` if not supplied. Streaming `chat.send()` parses the AI-SDK v3 line protocol (`0:` deltas, `d:` end markers, `3:` errors) — Node exposes `{ deltas: AsyncIterable, complete: Promise }`; Python yields `async for delta in chat.send(...)`.

**scope grammar extended** — `ApiKeyResource` enum extended from 3 → 8 types: added `chat`, `deploy`, `process`, `user`, `installer`. New constants `ALL_RESOURCES` + `SUPERADMIN_ONLY_RESOURCES` exported from `web/lib/apiKeyTypes.ts` so route validators + the dashboard scope picker can't drift.

**shared infrastructure** — three new helpers landed in Wave 0 of the sprint and are now used everywhere:
- `withIdempotency(request, ctx, rawBody, handler)` in [`web/lib/idempotency.ts`](../web/lib/idempotency.ts) — collapses the 12-line check→handler→save pattern into 4 lines for every mutating route. The existing `web/lib/idempotency.ts` was extended in-place; no parallel helper file was created.
- `emitMutation({kind, siteId, actor, targetId, attributes})` in [`web/lib/auditLogClient.ts`](../web/lib/auditLogClient.ts) — single parameterized helper covering all 7 mutation kinds (`deployment_mutated`, `process_mutated`, `machine_command_dispatched`, `user_mutated`, `site_member_mutated`, `installer_mutated`, `chat_mutated`). Fire-and-forget; never awaited.
- `requireMachineAuthAndScope` + `requirePlatformAuthAndScope` in [`web/app/api/_shared.ts`](../web/app/api/_shared.ts) — joined the existing `requireSiteAuthAndScope` / `requireRoostAuthAndScope` family. Single-line scope check at every route; no per-route boilerplate.

**cortex auth** — `web/app/api/cortex/route.ts` swapped from session-only `requireSession()` to `resolveAuth()` + `requireScope('chat', siteId, 'write')`. Dashboard callers (session/ID-token) bypass scope and continue to work unchanged; CLI / 3rd-party api-key callers must hold `chat=<siteId>:write`. SSE streaming context preserved.

**site membership canonical** — audited and locked: site membership lives **only** at `users/{uid}.sites[]`. The hypothesized inverse `sites/{siteId}.members[]` does not exist anywhere in the codebase; firestore.rules pins to the canonical model. New `getUserSiteIds(uid)` helper in [`web/lib/apiHelpers.server.ts`](../web/lib/apiHelpers.server.ts) so future callers don't reinvent the read pattern. Decision memo at `dev/completed/api-sprint/reference/membership-decision.md`.

**OpenAPI spec** — every new endpoint shipped with its spec entry alongside the route. Total: ~50 public scoped endpoints documented in `web/openapi.yaml`. Interactive reference at `/docs/api` (Scalar) and raw JSON at `/api/openapi`. Three pre-existing `Problem` → `ProblemDetails` ref typos fixed during the sprint-close verify.

**testing** — 1447/1447 web tests passing across 75 jest suites (was 1142 before the sprint, +305 new). 237/237 CLI tests passing across 29 suites (was 108, +129 new). 55 Node SDK tests + 57 Python SDK tests. 47 new Playwright e2e specs across 7 files in `web/e2e/specs/api-sprint/`. 6 new k6 scripts in `load-tests/k6/` covering the highest-traffic new endpoints with smoke/sustained/spike scenarios and per-VU per-iteration unique idempotency keys.

### deprecated

- Historical `/api/admin/*` docs are no longer the public contract. Use the scoped public equivalents (`/api/sites/{s}/deployments/*`, `/api/installer/*`, etc.); individual admin aliases may be internal, removed, or dashboard-only depending on the domain.

### removed

Nothing. The api-sprint is purely additive — internal callers and existing public roost endpoints are unaffected.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-05-05

### fixed — display-helper IPC permission denied on non-admin console users

`apply_display_topology`, `enumerate_display_modes`, and the related revert / self-test paths failed with `[Errno 13] Permission denied: 'C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\owlette_display_apply_*.req.json'` on any machine where the active console user wasn't a local admin. After 3 retries the auto-restore breaker latched and stopped attempting drift correction.

**root cause**: the agent service (running as `LocalSystem` in Session 0) wrote helper request JSON via `tempfile.gettempdir()` — which resolves to `C:\Windows\Temp` for `LocalSystem` — then spawned the helper as the console user via `CreateProcessAsUser`. Default ACLs on `C:\Windows\Temp` deny standard-user reads of SYSTEM-owned files, so the helper couldn't open the request file the service had just written. Worked fine when the console user happened to be a local admin, which is why it didn't surface universally.

**fix**: every cross-session display-helper IPC file (request, response, stderr) now lives under `%PROGRAMDATA%\Owlette\ipc\display\` via a new `_ipc_tempdir()` helper. The directory's DACL is set explicitly at first use — `SYSTEM:Full + Administrators:Full + console-user-SID:Modify`, with `PROTECTED_DACL` inheritance disabled so the installer's `users-modify` ACE on `ProgramData\Owlette` doesn't propagate down and let any interactive user tamper with IPC payloads between SYSTEM-write and helper-read.

Also covers the two enumeration paths (`--enumerate-json`, `--enumerate-modes-json`) that had the same bug, sweeps stale `owlette_display_*.{req,out}.json` and `*.tmp` files >1h old at first use, and adds a distinct `DisplayErrorCode.IPC_FAILURE` so request-read / response-write / stderr-redirect failures stop getting bucketed as generic `bad_request` (which was the reason this took 3 retries to surface as something operators could diagnose).

## [2.11.0] - 2026-04-25

### added — display alert routing (Feature B)

owlette now emits structured display events when monitor topology changes — drift, monitor added/removed/swapped, mosaic disabled, sync lost, apply succeeded/failed, auto-revert fired, apply-refused-mosaic. The new alert pipeline routes these through the existing email + webhook infrastructure with severity-aware delivery.

**routing table** — single source of truth at `web/lib/alerts/displayEventRouting.ts`. Severity decisions:
- **email + webhook (critical)**: `display_monitor_removed`, `display_apply_failed`, `display_auto_revert_fired`, `display_sync_lost`
- **webhook only (warning)**: `display_drift`, `display_monitor_swapped`, `display_mosaic_disabled`, `display_apply_refused_mosaic`
- **dashboard only (info)**: `display_monitor_added`, `display_apply_succeeded`

**critical-path bypass** — `display_monitor_removed` and `display_auto_revert_fired` skip the 3-min digest cron and email inline so operators see them in seconds. Everything else queues to `pending_display_alerts` and ships via the new `/api/cron/display-alerts` cron (3 min interval, 2 min accumulation window — same cadence as `pending_process_alerts`).

**operator-caused-drift suppression** — agent stamps `suppressAlert: true` + `correlatedApplyId` on display events that fire within 90s of a successful apply. The `/api/agent/alert` route honors the flag: skips email, still fires webhook. Closes the recall-then-N-drift-emails avalanche.

**rate limiting** — 1 per `(machineId, eventType)` per hour for most events; `display_drift` gets a tighter 1 per 4h window because cable-flap drift can fire repeatedly on rack-mount installations.

**preferences** — new `displayAlerts: boolean` toggle in account settings (opt-out, defaults to true). 30-day migration banner on `/admin/alerts` directs existing operators to the new control. Webhook config UI exposes all 10 new event ids as opt-in subscriptions (existing webhooks NOT auto-subscribed).

**dashboard surface** — new `events` tab on the display panel renders the last 50 display events for the selected machine, severity-color-badged, with relative timestamps. Subscription opens only when the tab is visible.

### added — auto-restore (Feature C)

opt-in per-machine toggle: when enabled, the agent automatically reapplies the stored layout on detected drift instead of waiting for a human to click recall.

**state machine** — drift detected → 30s topology-check tick → drift persists across 2 ticks (~60s) → fixability check (every drifted edidHash present in assigned) → cooldown clear → spawn worker thread → `apply_topology(..., auto_restore=True)` → emit `display_auto_restore_fired` audit. No watchdog (no operator to ack), no sentinel (next topology check re-fires from clean state if anything goes wrong).

**circuit breaker** — 3 consecutive auto-restore failures trip the breaker (`circuitBreaker.tripped: true` in the config doc). While tripped, `_maybe_auto_restore` short-circuits at gate 3 — no thread spawned, no further failures counted. Operator resets via the panel's banner (single click → `circuitBreaker.tripped: false, failures: 0`). Rate-limited responses (`AUTO_RESTORE_RATE_LIMITED`) and unfixable skips (`AUTO_RESTORE_SKIPPED_UNFIXABLE`) do NOT count toward the failure counter.

**fixability model** — only `display_drift` triggers auto-restore. `_monitor_added` (new monitor in live, not in assigned) and `_monitor_removed` (assigned monitor unplugged) are unfixable by re-applying assigned and would loop infinitely if attempted. The unfixable-skip emits `display_auto_restore_skipped_unfixable` (info severity) so operators see why the auto-fix didn't fire.

**dashboard surface** — `<Switch>` toggle in the panel header (any site member with write access; not admin-gated). When armed, a small "auto" micro-label + green dot renders next to the recall button. When tripped, a red banner appears at the top of the panel body with the last error and a single-click reset. Fleet-view: small red dot next to existing drift indicator on both `MachineCardView` + `MachineListView` so operators can spot tripped machines without expanding any panel.

**permissions** — `displays.autoRestore.enabled` writable by any site member (matches existing config-doc write rule). Admin role is reserved for cross-site administration, not per-site feature toggles. `circuitBreaker.tripped: false` reset uses the same gate. Agent retains exclusive write on `circuitBreaker.{failures, lastError, lastFailureAt, lastSuccessAt, trippedAt}`.

### added — remote-apply master kill switch + helper self-test (Wave 6)

Defence-in-depth gate over the apply path so a fresh agent doesn't auto-trust remote layout writes until an operator explicitly opts in.

**kill switch** — `apply_topology` now also reads `displays.remoteApplyEnabled` from the agent's local config. Anything other than literal `True` rejects the apply with `remote apply disabled by config` *before* any locks, audit events, or CCD calls. Distinct from `displays.enabled` (which gates the entire feature including drift detection); this flag scopes only the write path. Defaults `False` on fresh installs (`generate_config_file`); existing installs without the field also read as off.

**self-test** — `test_display_apply` command runs the apply helper in read-only mode (`QueryDisplayConfig` + `SetDisplayConfig(SDC_VALIDATE)` against the live config — never `SDC_APPLY`) so operators can verify the helper IPC plumbing (CreateProcessAsUser, env block, atomic response file) works end-to-end on a given machine *before* flipping the kill switch on. New `_self_test_via_user_session` service-side wrapper + `_helper_self_test_to_json` helper-mode entry. Surfaced in the dashboard panel only while `remoteApplyEnabled` is off.

### migration

- New Firestore subcollection: `pending_display_alerts/*` (digest queue). Created on first display event. No backfill needed.
- New machine config field: `displays.autoRestore.{enabled, enabledBy, enabledAt, circuitBreaker}`. Default-absent = disabled, breaker reads as not-tripped via the typed default sentinel in `useDisplayState`.
- New machine config field: `displays.remoteApplyEnabled: boolean`. **Default false on fresh installs and on existing installs with the field missing — operators must explicitly enable per machine via Firestore (or the upcoming dashboard toggle) before remote apply / auto-restore writes will land.** Existing operators relying on the v2.10 apply button must flip this to `true` after upgrading the agent.
- New user preference: `displayAlerts: boolean`. Missing field treated as `true` (opt-out semantics — existing users continue to receive display events until they explicitly disable).
- New cron required: `/api/cron/display-alerts` every 3 minutes via Railway cron (same cadence as `/api/cron/process-alerts`). Set the `X-Cron-Secret` header to the existing `CRON_SECRET` env var.
- No agent-side migration. v2.10+ agents emit display events through the existing log_event path; pre-2.10 agents simply don't emit them and the dashboard's events tab stays empty for those machines.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-04-24

### breaking — roost: `manifest` → `version` rename + per-roost version numbering

The release-engineering noun renamed end-to-end. What was a `manifest` (OCI/Docker borrow that confused TD-artist + signage operators) is now a `version` everywhere: API routes, SDK types, CLI commands, dashboard labels, Firestore sub-collection name, mediaType string, webhook events, error codes. Clean break — no backcompat shim, no redirect layer. **v2.10.0 is the cutover release.** Pre-2.10 agents cannot speak to a 2.10 web/api (wire protocol changed: `manifest_id`/`manifest_url`/`folder_id` in `sync_pull` payloads → `version_id`/`version_url`/`roost_id`); upgrade agents in lockstep with web.

**rename surface (mechanical)**
- API routes: `/api/roosts/{id}/manifests/*` → `/api/roosts/{id}/versions/*`. `/manifest-url` → `/version-url`. Old paths 404.
- Path param grammar: `{manifestId}` → `{versionRef}`. The `versionRef` resolver accepts six forms — see *new capabilities* below.
- Field names (camelCase): `manifestId` → `versionId`, `currentManifestId` → `currentVersionId`, `previousManifestId` → `previousVersionId`, `targetManifestId` → `targetVersion` (now `string | number`), `manifestUrl` → `versionUrl`, `manifestMetadata` → `versionMetadata`. Same renames in snake_case across Python SDK + agent (`manifest_id` → `version_id`, etc.).
- TypeScript types: `Manifest*` → `Version*` (`ManifestSummary` → `VersionSummary`, `ManifestDetail` → `VersionDetail`, etc.).
- SDK accessor: `client.manifests` → `client.versions` (Node + Python).
- CLI flags: `--manifest <id>` → `--version <ref>`; `--against <manifestId>` → `--against <versionRef>`; `--to <manifestId>` → `--to <versionRef>`.
- Webhook events: `manifest.published` → `version.published`. `Roost-Event` header values follow.
- Error codes: `manifest_stale` → `version_stale`, `manifest_not_found` → `version_not_found`, plus new `version_ref_malformed` (400) + `version_content_immutable` (400).
- mediaType: `application/vnd.owlette.manifest.v1+json` → `application/vnd.owlette.version.v1+json`.
- Firestore sub-collection: `sites/{s}/roosts/{r}/manifests/{id}` → `sites/{s}/roosts/{r}/versions/{id}`. Migration script at `scripts/migrate-manifest-to-version.mjs` (idempotent, supports `--dry-run` + `--rollback`, handles roost-doc field rename + `versionNumber` backfill).
- Agent wire protocol: `sync_pull` command payloads now use `version_id`/`version_url`/`roost_id` (was `manifest_id`/`manifest_url`/`folder_id`). Agent code at `agent/src/sync_version.py` (was `sync_manifest.py`).
- Firestore security rule: `match /manifests/{manifestId}` → `match /versions/{versionId}` under the roost sub-collection.

**new capabilities introduced alongside the rename**
- **Auto-incrementing per-roost `versionNumber`**: every push to a roost gets a 1-indexed integer (#1, #2, #3...) minted inside a Firestore transaction. Monotonic + gap-free even under concurrent publishes. Surfaced in API responses, dashboard list rows (`v3` badge), and CLI output.
- **Optional `description` field per version** (≤500 chars, plaintext): commit-message-style "what changed?" annotation. Set on push via SDK options or CLI `-m / --description <text>`. Editable after publish via `PATCH /api/roosts/{id}/versions/{ref}` — version *content* (files, chunks) stays immutable; only description can change. Denormalized to roost doc as `currentVersionDescription` so the dashboard list renders without N+1 reads.
- **Version-addressing resolver** (`web/lib/resolveVersion.ts`): every `{versionRef}` path param + CLI `--to`/`--against` accepts six forms — plain integer (`3`), `#3`, `v3`/`V3`, stable id (`vrs_*`), or alias (`current` / `previous` / `first`). Server resolves; SDKs/CLIs forward raw input verbatim.
- **New `roost roost versions <roostId>` CLI subcommand**: lists all versions for a roost with `#`, id, description, createdAt columns. Cursor-paginated, honors `--json`.
- **Dashboard UI**: roost rows show current `v{N}` badge + description preview + relative timestamp. Expanding a row reveals chronological version history with per-row three-dot menu (rollback to this version, copy version id, view files, diff against current). New "+ new version" button inside each expanded panel opens the push modal with name/extract-path/targets locked + pre-populated, so adding a version to an existing roost is one flow distinct from creating a new project. New-roost modal now requires a non-empty name.

**migration tooling**
- Firestore migration: `node scripts/migrate-manifest-to-version.mjs --project dev --dry-run` first, then run for real. Idempotent — skips already-migrated roosts. Backfills `versionNumber` (1, 2, 3...) sorted by `createdAt`. Renames roost-doc pointer fields. `--rollback` reverses via the per-run log file.
- Local agent state: SQLite columns renamed in `sync-state.db` schema. `SCHEMA_VERSION` was not bumped — existing dev installs need the file deleted before the new agent boots, or upgrade will throw `OperationalError` on first INSERT. Acceptable per the 2.10.0 clean-cutover semantics; flagged for installer-side cleanup follow-up.

**deferred follow-ups (post-rename)**
- R2 physical bucket migration: object keys still live under `project-manifests/{roostId}/{versionId}` in R2. Code references the prefix string with a marker comment (`web/lib/r2Client.server.ts`) until a dedicated migration script copies+deletes from `project-manifests/` → `project-versions/`. No wire impact — just a storage-layer rename.
- Browser-app `manifest.json` (PWA) is intentionally untouched — that's a Next.js metadata convention, not a roost concept.

**verification**
- 200 functions tests + 1,017 web tests + 28 node SDK tests + 101 CLI tests + 376 agent unit tests all green. Final repo-wide grep returns 17 hits, all in `dev/active/roost-version-rename/reference/rename-sweep-allowlist.txt` (R2 deferral, PWA reference, verb forms, intentional compat note, defensive test fixtures).
- Migration guide for any dev tester or early SDK user: `dev/active/roost-version-rename/MIGRATION.md`.

### added — roost (project distribution v2)

A content-addressed sync layer replacing v1's single-URL ZIP model. Turns roost into the release-engineering layer: deploy via drag-drop or URL, atomic rollback via pointer flip, dedup at chunk granularity, real retry + resume across tab close.

**storage + manifest model**
- 4 MiB fixed-chunk content addressing with per-tenant prefix `project-content/{siteId}/{hash[0:2]}/{hash}` on Cloudflare R2 — picked over S3/GCS for free egress, the only economic axis that matters at fleet fan-out.
- OCI Image Manifest v1.1 derivation (`application/vnd.owlette.manifest.v1+json`), immutable once written. A firestore pointer at `sites/{siteId}/roosts/{roostId}.currentManifestId` is the only mutable head.
- Schema spec + threat model + v1-to-v2 migration design at `docs/internal/{manifest-format,threat-model,v1-v2-migration}.md`.

**browser upload pipeline (dashboard)**
- `ProjectDistributionDialog` rebuilt as a two-mode dialog: `new deploy` (configure a new deployment — source is a sub-choice within: url vs upload files) + `history` (past manifests + rollback). Shared fields (distribution name, extract path, verify files, target machines, preset bar) apply across both sources. Dialog is mobile-responsive at 375px.
- Off-main-thread chunker + SHA-256 hasher in a web worker (`web/lib/chunking.ts`); AbortSignal-aware between chunks, streamed-slice memory (O(1) per chunk regardless of file size).
- IndexedDB-backed upload queue (`web/lib/uploadQueue.ts`) with parallelism (default 4), exponential backoff + jitter, 10-attempt cap. Crashed tabs leave `in_flight` tasks that get demoted to `pending` on re-open — close-and-re-drop resumes from wherever it stopped.
- Pre-upload confirmation (`PreUploadSummary`) showing file count, total size + dedup preview, est. upload time, per-target disk-free check (warns on unknown, blocks on insufficient + 20% margin), quota check (80% warning, exceed-cap error). Start button gated on blocking checks.
- Rollback confirmation dialog (`RollbackConfirmDialog`) with file-level diff (added/removed/changed), net byte delta, canary-vs-all-at-once strategy picker (canary default), problem+json error parsing.
- Filename sanitization (`web/lib/sanitize.ts`) — NFC normalisation, strips C0/C1 control chars + zero-width/RTL-override invisibles (ZWSP, LRM/RLM, LRO/RLO, BOM, etc.), windows-canonical trailing-dot/space trim, codepoint-safe 255-char truncation, rejects NUL bytes, path separators, `.`/`..`/empty-after-clean.

**server-side — web API surface (roost routes)**
- New routes at clean paths (no `/v2/` prefix — deliberate decision): `POST /api/chunks/{check,upload-urls,download-urls}`, `GET/POST /api/roosts/{roostId}/manifests`, `POST /api/roosts/{roostId}/rollback`. All 6 currently return 501 `notImplementedYet` stubs pending R2 wiring.
- RFC 7807 `application/problem+json` error envelope (`web/lib/apiErrors.ts`) — stable problem-type URIs, per-occurrence requestId for trace correlation, field-level error detail for 400/422. Replaces the legacy `{error: string}` shape for roost routes.
- OpenAPI 3.1 spec extended (`web/openapi.yaml`) with roost tag, all 6 paths, `ProblemDetails` + `OciManifest` + `ManifestSummary` schemas, reusable `Problem4xx` + `Problem501` responses, bearer-token scheme for firebase ID tokens. Live docs at `/docs/api` (Scalar renderer).
- Strict CI drift gate: `.github/workflows/openapi-validate.yml` runs on PR + push; any undocumented route under `/api/chunks/*` or `/api/roosts/*` hard-errors.

**server-side — cloud functions**
- `onRoostWritten` + `onTargetStateWritten` (`functions/src/distributionFanout.ts`) — canary-first fan-out. 10%/floor-1/cap-50 canary cohort via stable FNV-1a hash of `machineId + manifestId` (deterministic across retries). Abort threshold evaluates against total-not-settled, so a rollout already past 25% failure aborts without waiting for stragglers. Cloudflare 2025-11-18 all-at-once lesson explicitly honored.
- `verifyChunk` (`functions/src/chunkVerify.ts`) — SHA-256 verify on every R2 PUT via Cloudflare Worker webhook; planted-bytes get deleted + alerted.
- `chunkGcNightly` (`functions/src/chunkGc.ts`) — two-phase mark-and-sweep with 30-day tombstone TTL. Resurrection guard: a chunk referenced again before TTL elapses has its tombstone cleared (never deleted). `CHUNK_GC_MODE=dry-run` default for the first production month.
- `preUploadCheck` + `reconcileQuota` (`functions/src/quotaEnforce.ts`) — per-tenant storage quota. Admit reserves pending-bytes atomically (concurrent uploads can't both fit when sum > cap). Daily reconcile fires only newly-crossed 50%/80%/100% alarms (no refire at steady state). Pricing tiers: free 5 GB / starter $8 25 GB / pro $15 100 GB / enterprise BYO.
- Telemetry + cost attribution (`functions/src/telemetry.ts`) — R2 pricing model ($0.015/GB-month storage, $4.50/M class-A, $0.36/M class-B, $0 egress), GB-day averaging on storage snapshots (not latest), OTLP-shaped structured logs for downstream collector.
- Append-only audit log (`functions/src/auditLog.ts`) — SHA-256 hash-chained records; deletion + mutation both detectable. 7-year retention, BigQuery cold-storage sink.
- Webhook dispatcher (`functions/src/webhookDispatch.ts`) — 7 event types (`distribution.{queued,started,succeeded,failed}`, `chunk.uploaded`, `manifest.published`, `rollback.executed`), HMAC-SHA256 signed (`sha256=<hex>`), retry queue with exponential backoff (5 s × 3 × 1 h cap × ±20% jitter, 10-attempt cap). `classifyResponse` maps 2xx=success, 408/425/429/5xx=retry, other-4xx=permanent.

**agent sync pipeline (windows service)**
- `sync_commands` / `sync_manifest` / `sync_downloader` / `sync_state` / `sync_assembler` / `sync_scrub` modules (`agent/src/`) implementing the end-to-end v2 pipeline. ~350 new unit tests covering fetch + diff + cache, range resume (`Range: bytes=N-`), verify failure, URL refresh, atomic assembly, drift detection.
- Destination allowlist (`agent/src/destination_allowlist.py`) — fail-closed: empty/missing rejects all writes. Realpath-based; rejects symlinks/junctions (via `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT` check — catches cve-2022-21658 / cve-2025-4330 class), windows reserved device names (NUL/CON/PRN/COM1-9/LPT1-9, any case, with or without extension), alternate data streams, path traversal.
- Path-traversal + TOCTOU hardening (`sync_assembler.py`) — post-rename realpath check catches parent-dir symlink-swap between allowlist validation and the rename landing; suspect files get quarantine-deleted. Sibling-prefix regression (`/foo/bar-extra` must NOT satisfy root `/foo/bar`) covered via separator-suffixed prefix match.
- Explicit ACL on extracted files — `SYSTEM` + `Administrators` only, inheritance stripped. Fixed a 0x80000000 overflow on python 3.9 + pywin32 that was silently no-op'ing the ACL hardening in prior builds.
- Long-path support (`\\?\` prefix for >260-char paths), throttled progress reporting (every 5% or 30 s, not every chunk), real cancellation (flag checked between chunks, atomic rename completes if in flight, no corrupted files), locale + accented filename support (French/Spanish/German/Nordic accents, CJK, Arabic/Hebrew RTL, emoji with surrogate pairs, NFC/NFD).

**security / ops / observability**
- Per-site kill switch (`sites/{siteId}.roostEnabled`) — agent checks before every `sync_pull`; web routes gate via `gateOrProceed()` returning 503 problem+json. Fail-open on read error (a transient firestore blip must not silently disable a customer). 30 s TTL on both sides → flip propagates within 60 s. Matching python + ts implementations, field-name-pinned on both sides.
- No-token-logs lint gate (`scripts/check-no-token-logs.mjs`) — scans TS/JS/TSX/MJS + Python for log calls that interpolate auth-token identifiers, handles f-strings and template literals, 6 must-flag + 5 must-pass self-test fixtures. Runs via `.github/workflows/no-token-logs.yml` on PR + push. Plus an ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` rule for dev-time IDE feedback.
- SLSA Build Level 3 pipeline (`.github/workflows/build-installer.yml`, doc at `docs/internal/slsa-build-l3.md`) — hermetic windows build with pinned Inno Setup 6.2.2 + Python 3.11, keyless sigstore signing via github OIDC, reusable workflow pinned to `slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator@v2.0.0` (not `@main`, prevents silent chain-of-trust degradation). Verify job runs `slsa-verifier v2.6.0` against artifact + provenance before the release ships.
- k6 load-test suite (`load-tests/k6/`) with SLO targets enforced as thresholds — chunks/check p99 < 200 ms, upload-urls < 500 ms, download-urls < 400 ms, finalize-manifest < 800 ms, rollback < 400 ms. Base reliability gate: `http_req_failed < 0.01`. Includes a **race scenario** on finalize-manifest (20 VUs × same `expectedCurrentManifestId` → P0 CAS regression guard: exactly one 201, rest 412).
- Architecture doc (`docs/architecture.md`) extended with the roost section: storage layout, manifest format, browser upload pipeline mermaid, agent sync pipeline with per-module links, canary-first rollout algorithm, security floor, explicit restatement of the clean-cutover decision.

### added — playwright e2e suite

A Playwright end-to-end test suite running the full web dashboard against Firebase emulators (Auth :9099, Firestore :8080, Storage :9199). Covers 50+ specs across six phases:

- **Phase A** — emulator wiring + smoke (4 specs): Admin SDK branch routing, sentinel canary for `firebase-admin.ts`
- **Phase B** — auth flows (4 specs): login, logout, signup, HttpOnly session cookie round-trip via `page.evaluate(fetch)` pattern
- **Phase C** — account + settings (8 specs): profile update, passkey enrol/delete, preferences, password change with fixture-isolation (dedicated `password-test-user` prevents Firebase token revocation from poisoning other specs)
- **Phase D** — dispatch flows (22 specs): reboot, shutdown, kill-process, recall/store/clear display layouts, deployment create/progress/cancel/retry, roost create, rollback auth + validation
- **Phase E** — time-travel flows (10 specs): `page.clock`-driven specs for reboot countdown, cancel-lockout threshold, display-apply deadline auto-revert, heartbeat staleness → offline flip, heartbeat recovery via onSnapshot overwrite
- **Phase F** — CI + hardening: `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` with Temurin JDK 21, Playwright browser caching keyed on `@playwright/test` version, `firebase emulators:exec` wrapper, artifact upload on failure (14-day retention)

Infrastructure highlights: `roleState()` helper for pre-authenticated specs, `stubCommand` / `completeCommand` agent-stub helpers, `seedMachine` + `seedBaseline` deterministic seeding, per-spec `page.clock.install({ time: Date.now() })` pattern (must precede `page.goto` for React's setInterval to bind to the fake clock). Full guide at `web/e2e/README.md`.

### decisions locked (roost)

- **No `/api/v2/` URL prefix** — the new routes ARE the API.
- **No backwards compatibility with v1 agents** — clean cutover, the v2.10.0 agent is a hard requirement. No dual-write window, no shadow-read, no `project_url` fallback. Operators re-roost on v2; existing v1 distributions end at cutover.
- **No header-based versioning** (no `Accept: application/vnd.owlette.v2+json`).
- **v3-deferred** (do NOT rebuild in v2): bidirectional sync, LAN swarm, Ed25519 manifest signing, public CLI + GitHub Action, FastCDC, chaos rack.

### changed
- **Three-role permission model** — `member` / `admin` / `superadmin` replaces the two-tier `user` / `admin` scheme. Superadmins retain platform-wide god-mode (user management, installer uploads, access to every site regardless of assignment). The new `admin` tier is site-scoped: site admins get elevated rights only on the sites in their `sites[]` — they can edit site config, delete machines, and manage display layouts without holding any platform-level powers. Members keep standard site-scoped access.
- **User-management page redesigned** for the new model: role selector is now a three-option dropdown (with icons, colour, and inline descriptions of each role's capabilities); stats cards show per-role counts; admin rows display the specific sites each admin is responsible for (small pills, easy to scan). Self-demotion guard narrowed — superadmins are still blocked from self-demotion (platform-lockout risk), but admins can demote themselves since no cross-site powers are in play.
- **Superadmin visual indicator** — small red "superadmin" Crown pill appears next to the user avatar on every authenticated page when signed in as a superadmin. Signals god-mode so routine site ops don't accidentally use elevated access.

### migration
- **Deploy order is load-bearing**: run `node scripts/migrate-roles.mjs --env=<dev|prod>` first, then `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`, then the web deploy. The migration flips existing `role: 'user'` → `'member'` and `role: 'admin'` → `'superadmin'` idempotently; supports `--dry-run`. Existing admins become superadmins automatically (semantics preserved). The new site-scoped `admin` tier starts empty — superadmins promote members via the user-management page. Reversed deploy order would transiently lock current admins out of their sites until the migration runs.
- **`scripts/migrate-profiles.mjs`** — one-shot bootstrap script for the multi-device metrics schema (shipped at 2.8.1). Iterates every `sites/*/machines/*` doc and writes a best-effort `hardware/profile` subdoc from legacy singular `metrics.cpu/disk/gpu/network.interfaces` fields. Skips machines that already have a profile or are on schemaVersion 2. Idempotent; supports `--env=<dev|prod>`, `--site=<id|all>`, `--dry-run`, `--force`. Useful for offline/stale fleets that haven't upgraded to the 2.8.1+ agent yet — gives the dashboard something renderable until the agent overwrites the bootstrap on its next startup.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-18

### added
- **Per-logical-volume disk IO monitoring** — agent now collects per-drive read/write throughput, IOPS, and busy% via WMI's `Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfDisk_LogicalDisk`. Each drive (`C:`, `L:`, etc.) reports its own rates instead of one system-wide aggregate; selecting a different drive in the dashboard shows that drive's specific IO. New Firestore field `metrics.diskio` is keyed by volume id (mirrors `metrics.disks` shape). History samples carry per-volume entries under `sample.dios = [{i, rb, wb, bu}]`.
- **Disk IO surfaces on machine cards and list rows** — selected drive's read/write rates shown as stacked `r <rate>` (green) / `w <rate>` (orange) lines, hidden when idle. Auto-scales between B/s, KB/s, MB/s, GB/s. List-view disk cell widened to 160px with a 2-column layout (usage stats left, IO right).
- **Disk IO chart series in the metrics detail panel** — per-volume sub-toggles for read/write/busy% with volume-qualified labels (`C: read`, `L: busy`). Read/write render on the hidden axis (throughput); busy% shares the default 0-100% axis. Tooltip and stats grid both volume-qualified.
- **Friendly GPU names in the detail panel** — UUID stays as the chart-data key (stable, unique) while toggle labels, chart legend, stats grid, and tooltip all show "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti" via a lookup against the static profile.

### changed
- **Network cards now use arrow notation** (`↑ <rate>` / `↓ <rate>`) instead of `TX` / `RX` text on both card and list views — language-independent, more compact, and a cleaner visual rhythm with the new disk r/w letters.
- **Metric cell clicks SWAP the detail panel** instead of merging — clicking disk then GPU shows only GPU lines, not both. Click expansion still adds every per-device id (all disks, all GPUs, all NICs) so the panel shows all devices of the clicked type.
- **Toggles can deselect everything** — the "must keep at least one selected" guard is gone. Empty chart is a valid state; the stats grid hides cleanly.
- **Stats grid headers lowercased** (`avg` / `max` / `min`) for consistency with the rest of the panel's UI copy.

### fixed
- **MetricsDetailPanel chart now re-measures when the tab becomes visible** — Recharts' ResponsiveContainer would occasionally hold a stale width while the tab was backgrounded (rAF + ResizeObserver throttling), then render the plot area offset to the right with blank space on the left. A synthetic `window.resize` event on `visibilitychange → visible` forces all charts to re-measure.
- **Watchdog timeouts actually unblock the metrics loop** — both `_wmi_logical_disk_with_timeout` (disk IO) and `_disk_usage_with_timeout` (disk partitions) used `with ThreadPoolExecutor` whose `__exit__` calls `shutdown(wait=True)`, blocking forever on a hung WMI/network-mount worker. Switched both to manual lifecycle with `shutdown(wait=False, cancel_futures=True)` so a hung worker leaks instead of stalling.
- **NSSM runner crash on first metrics tick** — `MockService` in `owlette_runner.py` was missing four attributes that `OwletteService.__init__` defines (`_display_check_counter`, `_cached_display_hash`, `_shutting_down`, `_reboot_attempt_started_monotonic`). The display topology check at the top of every loop iteration crashed with `AttributeError`, causing NSSM to thrash-restart. Added the missing initializations plus two more (`_last_status_signature`, `_last_status_write_time`) for the status-throttle path.
- **NaN-guarded disk IO history extraction** — cloud function now uses `Number.isFinite()` checks before pushing IO entries to a sample. Prevents a poisoned NaN field (rare but possible from upstream perf-counter glitches) from causing Firestore to reject the entire history write.
- **Disk IO detail-panel UX rebuild** — toggle list collapsed from a wall of `C: read` / `C: write` / `C: busy%` / `HarddiskVolumeN ...` labels (12+ buttons on a typical machine) to two camps with icons: `<HardDrive> C:` (storage / disk usage %) and `<ArrowDownUp> C:` (activity — when on, plots both read% and write% lines). `HarddiskVolumeN` raw partitions are filtered out at the agent so they never enter Firestore in the first place; existing entries fall out of the live doc on the next metrics upload (Firestore dot-notation replaces the field). Read/write rates are now plotted as % of max bandwidth on the same 0-100 axis as everything else — agent ships a hardware-class `maxBps` per volume (NVMe ≈ 3.5 GB/s, SATA SSD ≈ 550 MB/s, HDD ≈ 150 MB/s, etc., detected via `MSFT_PhysicalDisk` at first call) that ratchets up on observed peaks.
- **Disk IO watchdog timeout 2s → 10s** — the old 2s budget skipped the perflib LogicalDisk stalls that occur when the BITS service flips state during Windows Update / Delivery Optimization polling, causing ~12% of metrics ticks to report empty disk IO. Empirical: 2s and 5s both still skipped (3.6-3.7 timeouts/hr, perfectly spaced ~16 min apart matching SCM 7040 BITS demand↔auto cycles); the perflib provider lock during a BITS state change consistently exceeds 5s. 10s captures them — verified at zero timeouts over 23 min observation post-fix. The metrics loop runs in its own thread (not the main service loop) so a 10s WMI call doesn't stall anything else. (A persistent-worker variant of the WMI call was tried first but reproducibly triggered RPC_E_WRONG_THREAD on every call after the first — the python `wmi` package binds proxies to the apartment that created them, and reusing a cached proxy from a long-lived thread is incompatible with how the package hands off to the COM runtime. The per-call pattern stays.)

---

## [2.8.1] - 2026-04-14

### added
- **Per-device metrics schema (v2)** — metrics now key cpus/disks/gpus/nics by stable device id instead of the old singular `cpu`/`disk`/`gpu` fields. Each machine publishes a `hardware/profile` subcollection document (schemaVersion 1) describing its physical devices; heartbeats reference those ids and include a `primary` pick per kind (selected by busyness with 5% hysteresis so the display doesn't flicker). Multi-GPU rigs, multi-disk setups, and multi-NIC hosts now render every device instead of collapsing to the first one.
- **Per-user device selection preferences** — dashboard list and card views remember which device each user wants to see per machine, persisted to `users/{uid}/devicePrefs/global` in Firestore (no localStorage). The list view shows a column-header dropdown when any visible machine has >1 of a kind; each row falls back to its own `primary` when the selection isn't present locally.
- **`deviceResolvers` utility** — `resolveDevice`, `shouldShowDeviceDropdown`, and `unionIds` helpers with unit tests; shared by list view, card view, and the metrics detail panel.
- **Metrics detail panel persistence** — selected metric tabs (and selected NIC, when relevant) now persist per machine via `userPreferences.graphTabs`, so refreshing or switching sites no longer resets your view.

### changed
- **Agent hardware profile is built on-device** (`hardware_profile.py`) with signature-hash change detection and a 5-minute rate-limit gate; only re-uploads when hardware actually changes. Gate stamps its timestamp *before* `build_profile()` so a persistent WMI/disk failure doesn't storm the heartbeat loop.
- **`shared_utils.get_system_metrics_with_config` retained its legacy snake_case shape** (`cpu`/`memory`/`disk`/`gpu`/`network`) for in-process consumers (`mcp_tools`, `report_issue`, tray GUI) while also carrying the camelCase keys the v2 uploader needs; `skip_gpu` is honored again to keep the tray GUI free of `nvidia-smi` console-window flashes.
- **WMI calls from the metrics thread now initialize COM** via `pythoncom.CoInitialize()` so per-socket CPU detection works on dual-socket workstations instead of silently falling through to the psutil fallback.
- **Legacy singular metrics fields are deleted on v2 upload** (`metrics.cpu`/`metrics.disk`/`metrics.gpu` → `DELETE_FIELD`) so doc size doesn't grow with both schemas side by side.

### fixed
- **Cloud `metricsHistory` function reads v2 per-device maps** (via `primary` + first-entry) with v1 fallback, so sparklines and threshold alerts keep working across the rollout window instead of flatlining the moment a v2 agent reports.
- **`shimLegacyMachine` no longer clobbers a real profile** during the mixed-version window when a v2 agent has uploaded its profile doc but its next metrics write is still legacy-shaped.
- **`hardware_profile._mac_for` return type** tightened to `Optional[str]`.

---

## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-12

### added
- **Per-machine Cortex kill switch** — operators can toggle Cortex off on a specific machine from the Cortex header (`CortexPowerToggle`). The agent reads the `cortexEnabled` flag before every poll and, when disabled, rejects pending messages with a clear error back to the web UI instead of executing tool calls. Firestore security rules were extended to allow dashboard writes to `cortexEnabled` without granting write access to agent-only fields (`online`, `lastHeartbeat`).
- **Profile photo upload/remove** — users can upload an avatar from account settings (`AccountSettingsDialog`). Photos are stored in Firebase Storage at `users/{uid}/avatar.jpg` and surfaced throughout the UI via the new `UserAvatar` component (Cortex chat bubbles, page header). New `storage.rules` grant each user read/write access to their own avatar path only.
- **Copy-message button in Cortex chat** — hover-revealed `CopyButton` on each chat bubble copies the full message text (cortex or user) to the clipboard.
- **Cortex suggested-question additions** and new `docs/dashboard/timezones.md` reference page.

### changed
- **Relicensed from AGPL-3.0 to FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0** (Functional Source License, Version 1.1, Apache 2.0 Future License). Self-hosting, internal use, non-commercial use, and professional services remain freely permitted; only competing commercial products or services are restricted. Each release automatically converts to Apache License 2.0 two years after it is made available. Copyright holder is The Experiential Company.
- Updated license references across web dashboard footers, landing page, terms page, OpenAPI spec, docs site footer, agent GUI, and repository README to reflect the new license.
- **`run_powershell` allow-list removed** — the first-token regex was security theater (a semicolon-prefixed `Get-Date; Remove-Item` bypassed it trivially) and caused constant false rejections on legitimate multi-statement scripts (`foreach`, `if`, `try`, `$var = ...`). Accountability now comes from the Firestore audit trail (`cortex-events` + site logs) and the `[MCP-AUDIT]` local log, which captures a 500-char preview of every script. `run_command` retains its binary allow-list.
- **Tier 3 audit previews expanded from 100 → 500 chars for script-bearing tools** (`run_powershell`, `execute_script`). One-line commands still truncate at 100. Multi-line PowerShell/Python bodies are now actually readable in the site log instead of showing only the first line.
- **`mcp_tool_call` exempted from the per-type command rate limit.** Cortex fires tool calls in parallel by design and is already authenticated + audit-logged per call; a 5-second throttle broke parallel queries. Other command types remain rate-limited.
- **`get_event_logs_filtered` wrapped in `try`/`catch`** — "no matching events" now returns `[]` cleanly instead of surfacing as a non-zero exit with empty stderr.
- **`sync-versions.js`** now updates the shields.io README version badge, the "Current" lines in `docs/internal/version-management.md`, and "Last Updated" date stamps automatically.

### fixed
- **`_get_agent_health` MCP tool** was calling a `HealthProbe()` API that no longer existed; rewired to the current `HealthProbe(config_path, api_base).run()` shape and now returns `status`, `error_code`, `error_message`, `checked_at`, and `checks` alongside version/hostname/uptime.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-11

### added
- **14 new MCP tools for Cortex** — purpose-built Tier 2 admin tools with validated parameters. Eliminates most fallbacks to `execute_script` for common sysadmin scenarios and produces cleaner chat UX (one green tool call instead of 2-4 red-then-green retries).
    - **`manage_process`** — kill / suspend / resume any OS process by name or glob pattern. Refuses to touch critical system processes (lsass, winlogon, csrss, etc.).
    - **`manage_windows_service`** — full services.msc parity: start / stop / restart / pause / continue / set_startup / set_recovery / get_details. `set_recovery` configures the auto-restart-on-crash safety net (first/second/subsequent failure actions, restart delay, reset counter). `get_details` returns status, startup type, binary path, dependencies, and recovery config in one call.
    - **`configure_gpu_tdr`** — set Windows GPU TDR (Timeout Detection and Recovery) registry values (TdrDelay, TdrDdiDelay). Critical for TouchDesigner/Unreal workloads with heavy shaders.
    - **`manage_windows_update`** — pause/resume + full scheduling: set_active_hours, set_scheduled_install, set_restart_deadline, set_feature_deferral, set_quality_deferral.
    - **`manage_notifications`** — suppress Windows toast notifications, enable Focus Assist (priority_only/alarms_only), disable notifications per-app. Essential for kiosks so Windows/Teams/Defender toasts don't appear on exhibit displays.
    - **`configure_power_plan`** — set power plan + disable sleep/hibernate/screen blanking. Required for every 24/7 unattended installation.
    - **`check_pending_reboot`** (Tier 1) — detect whether a reboot is pending and why (Windows Update, CBS, pending file renames, SCCM).
    - **`manage_scheduled_task`** — full taskschd.msc parity: list / enable / disable / delete / run_now / stop / create / get_details / get_history. `create` supports full trigger schema (boot/logon/once/daily/weekly/on_event/on_idle), run-as principals (SYSTEM/LOCAL_SERVICE/NETWORK_SERVICE), and settings (start_when_available, restart_count, execution_time_limit, multiple_instances, etc.).
    - **`network_reset`** — flush_dns / renew_ip / restart_adapter / reset_winsock.
    - **`registry_operation`** — allowlisted registry read / write / delete. Explicit allowlist of safe prefixes (Winlogon, GraphicsDrivers, WindowsUpdate, Notifications, Power, Services); SAM / SECURITY / Cryptography hives blocked.
    - **`clean_disk_space`** — clean temp / windows_temp / prefetch / recycle_bin / owlette_logs with age filter and dry-run mode.
    - **`get_event_logs_filtered`** — fast event log queries via `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable`. Orders of magnitude faster than the older `get_event_logs` when filtering by process, event ID, or time window.
    - **`manage_windows_feature`** — add / remove / list Windows Optional Features, Capabilities, or AppX packages. Removes OneDrive / Xbox Game Bar / Cortana / Teams consumer bloat during kiosk provisioning. Critical Windows features are blocklisted.
    - **`show_notification`** — display an on-screen toast or modal message (opposite of manage_notifications). Useful when a tech is physically nearby.
- **Background reboot-pending auto-alert** — agent checks for pending reboot every 15 min and emits a site event via the existing `/api/agent/alert` pipeline. Dashboard admins see "Reboot pending on [machine]" alerts; configured email/webhook alerts fire automatically. Idempotent — alerts once per pending-state transition.

### changed
- **Cortex CLAUDE.md** — new "Prefer Tier 2 tools over Tier 3" section with a mapping table. Cortex will now reach for purpose-built tools first and fall back to `execute_script` only for novel tasks.
- All new Tier 2 tools emit structured `[MCP-AUDIT]` log entries for security monitoring.
- `mcp_tools.py` gained `_CRITICAL_PROCESSES` blocklist and `_SAFE_REGISTRY_PREFIXES` allowlist as hardcoded safety helpers.

### security
- `manage_process` refuses to kill critical Windows processes (lsass, winlogon, csrss, services, etc.) and Owlette's own service — can't be bypassed via tool parameters.
- `registry_operation` has explicit allowlist + blocklist; hives like SAM and SECURITY are unreachable regardless of params.
- `manage_windows_feature` has a hardcoded blocklist of features Owlette itself depends on (NetFx4, WMI-*, PowerShell*, core networking).
- Scheduled task creation uses argument-list subprocess calls and PowerShell string escaping to prevent command injection via task names, programs, or arguments.

---

## [2.6.6] - 2026-04-11

### fixed
- **Screenshot capture restored** — the v2.6.5 `run_python` sandbox blocked internal screenshot callers (`mss`, `PIL`, `os` imports denied), breaking the dashboard screenshot panel, Cortex `capture_screenshot` tool, crash screenshots, and live view. `execute_in_user_session` now accepts a `trusted=True` flag for first-party callers that bypasses the sandbox; the LLM-facing `run_python` MCP tool remains sandboxed (`trusted=False` default).

---

## [2.6.5] - 2026-04-11

### security
- **MCP tool hardening** — `run_command` now uses `shell=False` with `shlex.split(posix=False)` to prevent shell injection via metacharacters (`&&`, `|`, `;`). Allowlist still validates the first token.
- **Python sandbox** — `run_python` restricts `__builtins__` (no `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `os`, `subprocess`). Imports gated to safe stdlib modules only (math, json, re, datetime, etc.). `open()` and `getattr` are allowed for file I/O and introspection.
- **File I/O path validation** — `read_file` and `write_file` MCP tools validate paths against allowed directories (Owlette data, user profile, temp, configured process dirs). Blocks system directory access and path traversal.
- **PowerShell audit logging** — `execute_script`, `run_command`, `run_python`, `read_file`, `write_file` now emit `[MCP-AUDIT]` log entries for security monitoring.
- **Token exchange race fix** — registration code exchange uses two-phase pattern: validate → generate tokens → atomically mark used. Prevents burning codes on transient Firebase Auth failures.
- **Token refresh race fix** — refresh endpoint wrapped in Firestore transaction to prevent concurrent requests from creating inconsistent token state.
- **Command field allowlist** — `commands/send` API filters data fields per command type before writing to Firestore. Prevents field injection (e.g., overriding `timestamp` or `status`).
- **Error sanitization** — 60 API routes now use centralized `apiError()` helper that returns generic messages in production, hiding Firebase internals and stack traces.
- **Firestore rules hardened** — site creation requires `owner == auth.uid`, agent logs require `machineId == token.machine_id`, chat creation requires `userId == auth.uid` (with autonomous exception).
- **HSTS header** — `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` added.
- **Redirect validation** — login and MFA pages validate redirect/return URLs (must be relative paths, blocks protocol-relative `//` redirects).
- **Cortex nonce dedup** — autonomous endpoint accepts optional `nonce` field to prevent replay attacks.
- **Deployment checksum validation** — API validates SHA-256 format when provided; agent already enforces verification.

### changed
- Updated `next` 16.2.1 → 16.2.3 (Server Component DoS fix)
- Updated `iron-session` 8.0.3 → 8.0.4 (cookie out-of-bounds char fix)
- Updated `cryptography` 41.0.7 → ≥44.0.0 (hygiene; CVE-2023-50782 not exploitable in Fernet-only usage)
- `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` retained on `execute_script` (required for Group Policy–hardened kiosks)

---

## [2.6.4] - 2026-04-10

### added
- **Session state classifier** — new `session_state.py` module persists shutdown intent and last-alive timestamps across reboots. On startup, the agent classifies how the previous session ended and emits a warning event to the dashboard for anomalous shutdowns:
    - `external_reboot` — operator or Windows Update restarted the machine outside Owlette
    - `unexpected_reboot` — no shutdown signal detected (BSOD, power loss, hard reset)
    - `unexpected_service_restart` — agent process crashed or was killed (NSSM auto-restart)
    - Silent for Owlette-initiated reboots/shutdowns, version upgrades, and first runs
- Tooltips on event log action and detail text — truncated entries now show full text on hover (shadcn Tooltip, matching dashboard style)

### changed
- Reboot event log details cleaned up — human-readable info leads, entry UUID shortened to 8-char prefix for correlation (was full 36-char UUID)

---

## [2.6.3] - 2026-04-09

### fixed
- **CRITICAL**: scheduled reboot scheduler no longer fires entries that are more than 5 minutes late. A 5-minute "missed-fire grace window" silently skips any entry observed past its scheduled instant + 5 min, marks it as fired-for-the-day, and logs a `scheduled_reboot_missed` event to the dashboard. Previously, if the agent restarted (or a schedule entry was edited) AFTER the scheduled time, the agent would catastrophically fire the missed reboot the next time it observed the entry — hours late, with no warning, with no chance for the operator to cancel. This was the cause of an unintended reboot that destroyed days of in-progress rendering work on a dev machine
- Scheduled reboot scheduler no longer retries failed reboots. The previous 3-attempts-with-7-min-timeout retry loop is gone — a failed reboot is logged and dropped, never re-fired automatically
- Scheduled reboot scheduler now resolves entry times against the **machine's local timezone**, not the site timezone. A `14:00` entry on a Tokyo installation and a `14:00` entry on a New York installation in the same Owlette site now reboot at their respective local 14:00s, not synchronized to one shared timezone. The dashboard reboot-schedule editor was always timezone-agnostic — the agent was incorrectly applying the site timezone
- Tray icon "Exit" now actually stops the Owlette service. Previously it wrote a `tmp/shutdown.flag` file that the service detected and exited from, but NSSM's `AppExit Default Restart` immediately re-started the service, so Exit was a no-op the user couldn't see. Exit now triggers a UAC-elevated `net stop OwletteService` via the Service Control Manager, which is the only stop NSSM respects
- Latent `firestore_rest_client.set_document(merge=True)` bug fixed. When called without any `SERVER_TIMESTAMP` fields (e.g. every `set_machine_flag()` call), the function silently sent a PATCH without `updateMask.fieldPaths`, which the Firestore REST API treats as a full document REPLACEMENT — every field not in the request body was DELETED. This wiped `lastHeartbeat`, `online`, and `metrics` from the machine doc on every flag write, then the next `_upload_metrics` call (within ~1s) silently restored them. The bug had been latent in the codebase for an unknown length of time — only became visible when the new atomic startup flag-clear in this same release made the wipe gap large enough for the dashboard pill to flicker offline. Now correctly sends `updateMask` when `merge=True`
- Dashboard `MachineStatusPill` heartbeat parser hardened to handle every shape Firebase JS SDK v12 can return for a Timestamp field — `Timestamp` instance via `.toMillis()`, plain `{seconds, nanoseconds}` from cache rehydration, legacy `{_seconds, _nanoseconds}`, JS `Date`, plain number, ISO string. Previously, only the strict `Timestamp` instance shape was recognised; cache rehydrations dropped silently to `0`, which the staleness check then treated as "infinitely stale", flipping the dashboard pill offline
- Dashboard `rebootMachine()` and `shutdownMachine()` now write `configChangeFlag: true` alongside the optimistic countdown anchor. Without it, the firestore.rules `allow update` predicate rejected the write, so the optimistic countdown never appeared on the dashboard until the agent's own write came through (~5-10s later) — the perceived "the cancel button only appears right before the restart" bug

### changed
- Reboot countdown anchors `rebootScheduledAt` and `shutdownScheduledAt` are now Unix-seconds NUMBERS representing the TARGET reboot time (when the OS will actually restart). Previously they were Firestore server timestamps representing the START of a fixed 30-second countdown. The new semantic supports the new agent-side announce → 5-second pre-roll → 60-second OS countdown sequence, and the dashboard pill renders the countdown the moment the listener fires (no second round trip required)
- Agent reboot scheduler state file moved from `C:\ProgramData\Owlette\state\reboot_state.json` to `C:\ProgramData\Owlette\tmp\reboot_state.json`, alongside the existing `app_states.json` and `service_status.json`. The unused `state\` directory is removed entirely
- Tray Exit no longer writes `tmp/shutdown.flag`. The flag handler in the service main loop is also removed (it was dead code — see "fixed" above)

### added
- New `firebase_client.set_machine_flags(dict)` helper for atomic multi-field writes to the machine doc. Used by the new reboot announce path so the dashboard sees `rebootScheduledAt + rebooting + rebootSource + rebootCancellable + rebootEntryId` in a single listener tick instead of multiple intermediate states. Raises on failure (unlike the silent-log `set_machine_flag`) so callers can react

---

## [2.6.2] - 2026-04-08

### added
- Live cancel-reboot countdown on the dashboard — the status pill becomes a red pulsing `MM:SS` timer the moment a reboot or shutdown starts, anchored to a server-side `rebootScheduledAt` / `shutdownScheduledAt` timestamp so all viewers stay in sync and the countdown survives page refreshes
- Hover the countdown pill to reveal a "cancel" affordance; clicking it sends `cancel_reboot` and the pill returns to "online" once the agent confirms
- Context menu adapts during a pending reboot/shutdown — the reboot/shutdown items are replaced with a single red "cancel reboot" / "cancel shutdown" item, keeping the discoverable cancel path intact for users who don't notice the pill
- Final-5-seconds safety: pill becomes non-clickable and shows "rebooting…" because Windows `shutdown /a` is unreliable in the final phase
- Scheduled (cron) reboots now write the same countdown anchor, so they get the same live timer + cancel UX as manual reboots
- New shared `MachineStatusPill` component used by both list and card views — eliminates the duplicated status badge JSX and the now-redundant standalone cancel button in card view

### fixed
- Reboot/shutdown confirmation dialogs no longer claim "you can cancel during the countdown" without exposing any cancel UI — copy now reads "you'll have 30 seconds to cancel from the dashboard"
- `rebooting` and `shuttingDown` flags written by the agent are now actually read by the dashboard's Firestore listener — they were declared on the `Machine` interface but never propagated, so the existing "rebooting…" amber pill never displayed in production

---

## [2.6.1] - 2026-04-05

### added
- Batched process alert emails — crash alerts are queued for 2 minutes then grouped by site into a single digest email, preventing spam when multiple machines restart simultaneously
- New cron endpoint `/api/cron/process-alerts` drains the alert queue every 3 minutes and sends one digest email per site with a table of all affected machines/processes
- Digest email adapts: single alert uses the familiar single-process layout, multiple alerts show a grouped table

### fixed
- Owlette's built-in process restart (kill-and-relaunch for hung processes) no longer triggers false "process crashed" emails — writes KILLED status before terminating
- Scheduled and dashboard-initiated machine reboots/shutdowns no longer trigger crash alert emails — agent suppresses alerts during the shutdown window
- Removed unused `buildProcessAlertEmail` from alert route (moved to cron digest)

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-04

### added
- Sentry error monitoring for both web dashboard and agent — captures unhandled exceptions with full stack traces, machine identity tags (hostname, site_id, project_id), and user context
- Agent Sentry events include structured machine context (hostname, site, version) for quick triage
- Sentry tunnel route on web to bypass ad-blockers
- `sentry` config section in agent config.json (disabled by default, preserved during Firestore sync)

### fixed
- Firestore config sync now preserves local-only keys (`firebase`, `sentry`) via `LOCAL_ONLY_KEYS`
- Sentry init added to NSSM runner (owlette_runner.py) — previously only in unused OwletteService.__init__
- Pre-existing stale test failures fixed: apiAuth NextRequest type, installer_utils terminate vs kill, shared_utils config/metrics API mismatches, removed deleted sanitize_process_name test

---

## [2.5.9] - 2026-04-03

### added
- Rich startup diagnostics logged on every service start: version banner (hostname, timezone, environment, Python version, Windows edition + build, install/data paths), system snapshot (CPU model + cores, RAM, disk free space, GPU name + VRAM, IP addresses), config summary (Firebase enabled, site ID, process count, Cortex status), startup phase timings (health probe, Firebase init, Firebase start), and a startup-complete summary block (version, total elapsed time, Firebase status, process count)

---

## [2.5.8] - 2026-04-03

### fixed
- `requireAdmin` middleware now accepts both API keys and Firebase ID tokens — previously only one auth method worked depending on route
- Firestore collection renamed from `apiKeys` to `api_keys` for naming consistency
- Cortex lowercase enforced across all user-facing text
- Phantom QR code references removed from device pairing flow
- Firestore timestamps standardised to `serverTimestamp()` across all writes
- Dead `presence?.online` fallback patterns removed from web reads
- Device code documents now deleted on consumption/expiry instead of being marked with a status field

---

## [2.5.7] - 2026-04-02

### added
- FAQ section on landing page
- Pricing section on landing page

### fixed
- Update log event no longer writes version string into the `level` field
- Update log messages lowercased; version strings prefixed with `v`
- "Updating owlette" label shown in dashboard while agent update is in progress
- Landing page explore link spacing polished

---

## [2.5.6] - 2026-04-02

### added
- API and Webhooks promoted to top-level nav section in docs

### fixed
- `presence?.online` dead fallback patterns removed from web dashboard reads

---

## [2.5.5] - 2026-04-02

### added
- Per-user alert emails — each user receives alerts for their own assigned machines
- Timezone labels in email alerts
- Centered unsubscribe link in alert emails

### fixed
- Missing Firestore indexes added; `claude-agent-sdk` dependency pinned

---

## [2.5.4] - 2026-04-01

### added
- **Process scheduling UX overhaul** — redesigned schedule editor with overnight schedule support (e.g. 22:00–06:00 spanning midnight)

### fixed
- Site members can now access machine controls without requiring admin role

---

## [2.5.3] - 2026-04-01

### fixed
- **Auto-update now reliably replaces Python files** — replaced deprecated WMIC `call terminate` with PowerShell `Stop-Process -Force` in the installer's `InitializeSetup()` phase. WMIC was silently failing to kill Python processes before file overwrite, causing Inno Setup to schedule locked DLLs for next-reboot replacement (which never comes during auto-update). Two-pass kill with verification ensures all handles are released before file copy begins.

---

## [2.5.2] - 2026-03-31

### changed
- Version bump

---

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-31

### added
- Agent longevity hardening for 24/7 uptime — fixed resource leaks, unbounded queue growth, and error handling across all background threads
- Windows console event signal handling (`CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT` etc.) in the agent runner
- Version number logged at service startup

### fixed
- Dashboard machine online/offline status delay reduced from ~27s to ~4s
- Slow command worker thread must start after `self.running = True` (previously caused worker to exit immediately)
- Killed processes no longer trigger crash detection and relaunch
- Parallel install support for Cortex `deploy_software` — existing registry keys hidden from installer to prevent unintended removal of previous versions
- Cortex now requires explicit user confirmation before calling `deploy_software`
- `install.bat` service detection switched to registry query — `nssm status` returned non-zero for stopped services, causing upgrade installs to skip removal and fail on re-registration

### performance
- Landing page Lighthouse score improved from 69 to 89

---

## [2.4.4] - 2026-03-31

### added
- **Cortex `deploy_software` tool** — AI-driven software deployment with full pipeline tracking (download, silent install, verify, Deployments page visibility). Server-side tool with user confirmation required
- **Cortex `get_system_presets` tool** — Retrieves admin-configured software presets (installer URLs, silent flags, verification paths) for use with `deploy_software`
- **12h/24h time format preference** — User preference persisted to Firestore, applied across schedule editor, time pickers, and dashboard
- `listen_to_document` returns a `wake_event` for instant polling on Firestore writes

### fixed
- `deploy_software` overrides `/DIR` flag to match the target version install path
- Bidirectional config sync between agent and Firestore
- Network metrics flickering on dashboard
- Process list not detecting running processes; added Deployments link
- Cortex sidebar categories sorted by recency, batch categorize fixed
- Schedule editor time picker opens upward when near bottom of viewport
- `timeFormat` preference not persisting due to missing equality check

---

### fixed
- Agent Bearer token auth in bug-report API route
- Email template: logo URL fallback, auto-link color, footer links, Gmail clipping
- Landing page layout: 4K centering, mobile accordion, hero vertical alignment, subheadline jitter

---

## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-26

### changed
- **Agent pairing replaces browser OAuth** — Agents now authenticate via device code flow. The installer displays a 3-word pairing phrase, auto-opens the pairing page in a browser, or users enter the phrase on the dashboard
- Installer publisher, URLs, and fallback version updated

### fixed
- Installer pairing UX — auto-opens browser, improved colors, handles failure gracefully
- Rate limits increased; pause added on pairing failure
- Dashboard button and status badge hover states

### removed
