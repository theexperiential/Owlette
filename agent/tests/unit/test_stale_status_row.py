"""a dead process must never keep reading green.

THE BUG (reported 2026-09-12, reproduced from this machine's service.log):
close a managed app by hand, then switch its launch mode to off before the
5-second loop next looks at it, and the desktop dot stays green on a process
that is gone.

THE MECHANISM, which is one rung up from where it looks: the service writes a
status when it LAUNCHES a process and when it deliberately stops one, and never
when a process dies on its own. The stale RUNNING row is normally superseded by
the RELAUNCH's new row -- so the row is only ever corrected as a side effect of
relaunching. Remove the relaunch and nothing corrects it. Switching the mode to
off is one way to remove it; an exhausted attempt count and a scheduled entry
that has left its window are others, and neither involves a launch-mode change
at all. handle_process's dead-pid branch (the `else` under
`if last_pid and Util.is_pid_running(last_pid)`) is where the service KNOWS the
pid is dead, so that is where the row is retired.

The freeze was bounded at five minutes by cleanup_stale_tracking_data -- except
when Windows recycled the pid, because that sweep gated on bare
psutil.pid_exists with no identity check, and any unrelated process inheriting
the number kept the row alive forever. _pid_still_ours closes that.

NEGATIVE CONTROLS (repo rule -- a guard that never failed proves nothing).
These three FAIL against the pre-fix owlette_service.py:
  - test_running_row_is_retired_when_the_mode_goes_off_mid_tick
  - test_running_row_is_retired_when_the_relaunch_is_skipped_by_schedule
  - test_sweep_drops_a_row_whose_pid_was_recycled
The keep tests (RESTARTING, KILLED, live pid, no identity record) pass both
before and after: they pin what the fix must NOT disturb.

House patterns: real OwletteService method bodies descriptor-bound onto a
SimpleNamespace, FakeProc + a monkeypatched psutil process table, and a
redirected state file -- all from test_launch_failed.py, which is the closest
analogue. owlette_service is imported lazily inside tests so collection order
cannot double-initialise the cryptography PyO3 bindings.
