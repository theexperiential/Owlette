"""The Cortex IPC pump must not execute on the 5-second main service loop.

Until 2026-09-07 `_process_cortex_ipc_commands` ran the tool inline on the tick.
A single `capture_screenshot` costs ~55s end to end (user-session poll plus the
upload POST), so one screenshot stalled process monitoring, the heartbeat and
every other loop duty for that whole window — the blocking-the-main-loop
landmine, in the place that hit it most reliably.

Method bound onto a SimpleNamespace via the descriptor protocol, matching
test_cortex_process_command.py, so the production body runs without building a
Windows service.
