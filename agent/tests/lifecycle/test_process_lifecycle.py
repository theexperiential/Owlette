"""Real-process lifecycle suite - the executable contract for process
identity 3.3.0 (plan: dev/active/process-identity/plan.md).

Two sets, one rule (D1): owlette operations touch ONLY processes owlette
manages - ones it launched, or ones it deliberately inherited.

CHARACTERISATION SET - behaviour that is correct today and must stay green
through every wave. Each test pins a load-bearing production path end to
end against REAL processes: real spawns, real psutil, real state files
(redirected), real OwletteService method bodies (descriptor-bound).

NEW-CONTRACT SET - the managed-or-inherited rule itself, written before the
implementation existed. Each landed as xfail(strict=True) tagged with the
wave that had to flip it; an early pass was itself a failure (a guard that
never failed proves nothing - repo rule), and every red was verified to fail
for its contract reason before implementation began. All six flipped green
across Waves 2-5 (markers removed at each flip, comments record which wave
and why); the bodies remain frozen as the permanent contract.

All processes are decoy-image copies (owlette-e2e-decoy-<runid>.exe); no
real-world image name ever appears in a destructive argument. See
conftest.py for the harness contract (decoys, launch seam, isolation probe,
leak policy, forward identity-row schema).
