"""
sync_assembler — atomic file reassembly for roost (project distribution v2).

concatenates content-store chunks into `<extract_root>/<version_path>` via a
`<path>.partial` sidecar that is fsynced then `os.replace`d, so a live file is
never partially overwritten.

- destination_allowlist gates EVERY target path before any disk write; empty
  allowlist rejects everything (fail-closed). runs as SYSTEM, so that gate plus
  the sync guard rails are what stop customer-path → SYSTEM-write escalation.
- cancellation is honored between files only — mid-file would leave a
  wrong-sized file on disk.
- assemble-then-prune: a crash between the two leaves a complete superset (old
  files still playable) rather than a tree with files missing.

not here: chunk download (sync_downloader), version fetch (sync_version), HTTP.
