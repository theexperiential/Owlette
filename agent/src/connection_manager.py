"""
Connection Manager for Owlette Agent

Centralized connection state management implementing industry-standard patterns:
- State Machine: DISCONNECTED -> CONNECTING -> CONNECTED (with RECONNECTING, BACKOFF states)
- Circuit Breaker: Prevents hammering server during outages
- Thread Supervision: Watchdog monitors and restarts dead worker threads
- Exponential Backoff with Jitter: Prevents thundering herd problem
- Single Reconnection Queue: No duplicate reconnection attempts

This module is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for connection state.
All components report errors through this manager, and it coordinates recovery.

Usage:
    from connection_manager import ConnectionManager, ConnectionState

    # Create manager
    conn_mgr = ConnectionManager(logger)

    # Set callbacks
    conn_mgr.set_callbacks(connect=do_connect, disconnect=do_disconnect)

    # Register supervised threads
    conn_mgr.register_thread("command_listener", lambda: Thread(target=cmd_loop))

    # Start
    conn_mgr.connect()
    conn_mgr.start_watchdog()

    # Report errors from any component
    conn_mgr.report_error(exception, "Metrics upload failed")

    # Report success to reset failure counters
    conn_mgr.report_success()
