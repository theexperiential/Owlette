    Both UIs have rendered this status for years (red dot, "failed"); nothing
    ever wrote it. A failed launch or an identity-refused operation was an
    Error: string in a log while the entry's dot sat at the hollow INACTIVE
    ring - indistinguishable from launch-mode-off. Returns True when a row
    was (or already is) surfaced, False when the entry has nothing to surface
    on.

    THE NO-PID PROBLEM (WHY a row is REUSED, never fabricated): a failed
    launch has no live pid to key a fresh row by, and every top-level key in
    app_states.json must stay a numeric pid string - the desktop parser
    (parseAppStates) prunes non-numeric keys and persists the pruned document
    (D2's rule), and a fabricated numeric pid would collide with a real
    process the moment Windows hands that number out. So the status lands on
    a row that already exists:
      - the refused pid's own row, when the caller names one still bound to
        this entry (an identity refusal marks the row involved; a row bound
        to a DIFFERENT entry is never touched - defacing it would show
        "failed" on a healthy neighbour);
      - otherwise the entry's newest existing row, a dead generation from a
        previous launch. statusForProcess falls back to INACTIVE only when
        NO row carries the entry's id (verified against processStatus.ts),
        so the newest dead row surfaces the failure for every entry that has
        ever launched.
    The unreachable case is an entry that has NEVER produced a row: it
    stays INACTIVE. For a blank exe_path the desktop's
    launchModeBlockedReason copy explains why next to the entry; a path
    that is present but broken from creation stays INACTIVE with only the
    log and the Error: command result to say why - the cost of never
    fabricating a row (accepted above over colliding with a recycled pid).

    Identity fields are STRIPPED from the reused row: the record described a
    process that is gone, and a stale record would have the row dropped as
    recycled at the next service restart or by the gate - while recordless
    rows are the ones recovery deliberately keeps. Sibling LAUNCH_FAILED
    rows of the same entry are folded into the target so repeated failures
    never accumulate rows.

    Clearing is the existing write paths' behaviour (verified, pinned in
    test_launch_failed.py): a bind to the same pid overwrites the row's
    status; a bind to a new pid writes a newer-timestamped row that wins the
    desktop's recency sort immediately, and the stale-row sweep clears the
    leftover once the entry has a live row again. Module-level for the same
    descriptor-binding reason as _inherit_identity_extra.

          2. ANNOUNCE to Firestore — best-effort with retry. Writes a single
             atomic merge of (rebootScheduledAt, rebooting, rebootSource,
             rebootCancellable, rebootEntryId) so the dashboard sees a
             consistent state in one listener tick. rebootScheduledAt is a
             client-computed UTC wall-clock instant — NOT a server timestamp —
             so the dashboard can render the countdown the moment it sees the
             doc, with no second round trip required.
          3. PRE-ROLL: short fixed sleep so the dashboard listener has time
             to receive the announce and render the countdown BEFORE the
             Windows toast appears. Tunable via REBOOT_ANNOUNCE_PREROLL_SECONDS.
          4. Issue `shutdown /r /t REBOOT_OS_COUNTDOWN_SECONDS`. The agent
             main loop stays alive during the OS countdown and processes
             cancel commands in real time.
          5. If the OS shutdown command itself fails: clear all state and
             flags, log the failure. NEVER retry.

        OFFLINE BEHAVIOUR (CRITICAL): if Firestore is unreachable or the
        announce fails after retries, the reboot STILL FIRES. The whole
        point of local reboot_state.json + lastFiredByEntry + the 5-min
        missed-fire window is to make scheduled reboots resilient to
        internet outages. The local state machine is the source of truth.
        Firestore is a visibility channel for the dashboard — not an
        authorization gate. Without this property a kiosk in a museum with
        flaky wifi would silently stop rebooting on schedule.

        don't grow indefinitely.

        the cache is REBUILDABLE from R2 — chunks re-download on the next
