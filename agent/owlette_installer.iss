; Owlette Installer Script for Inno Setup
; ============================================================================
; This script creates a professional Windows installer for Owlette
; Requires: Inno Setup 6.x (https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
; ============================================================================
;
; AUTHENTICATION:
; ---------------
; This installer uses device code / QR pairing authentication.
; The agent displays a 3-word pairing phrase and QR code. The user
; authorizes from their phone, the dashboard, or via /ADD= for bulk deploy.
; Tokens are encrypted in C:\ProgramData\Owlette\.tokens.enc.
;
; PAIRING FLOW:
; -------------
; Method 1 (QR Code - interactive):
;   1. Installer runs configure_site.py (displays QR code + pairing phrase)
;   2. User scans QR with phone → owlette.app/add → selects site → authorizes
;   3. Agent polls for authorization, receives tokens
;
; Method 2 (Dashboard - manual):
;   1. Installer displays pairing phrase (e.g., "silver-compass-drift")
;   2. User enters phrase on dashboard → "+" button → "Enter Code"
;
; Method 3 (Silent - bulk deploy):
;   1. Admin generates phrase on dashboard → "+" button → "Generate Code"
;   2. Run: Owlette-Installer.exe /ADD=silver-compass-drift /SILENT
;
; SECURITY:
; ---------
; - No browser login required on target machine
; - Pairing phrases: 3 words, 10-minute expiry, single-use
; - Tokens can be revoked via web dashboard
; - Access token: 1 hour expiry (auto-refreshes)
; - Refresh token: never expires (admin-revocable, stored encrypted)
;
; BUILD PARAMETERS:
; -----------------
; /SERVER=prod  → Uses owlette.app (production) — DEFAULT when /SERVER is omitted
; /SERVER=dev   → Uses dev.owlette.app (development)
;
; Example:
;   Owlette-Installer-v2.0.0.exe /SERVER=prod
; ============================================================================

; VERSION MANAGEMENT
; ------------------
; Version is read from VERSION file at build time (passed via /DMyAppVersion=X.X.X)
; If not provided, defaults to reading from VERSION file via ReadIni workaround
; To bump version: Edit agent/VERSION file and rebuild
; Build script (build_embedded_installer.bat) validates VERSION file exists and passes it here

; 3.0.0: the three shortcuts below all changed target — they used to run
; pythonw.exe against owlette_gui.py / owlette_tray.py (both deleted) via the
; scripts\launch_*.bat hops (also deleted). Delete them rather than let [Icons]
; rewrite them in place, so no shell-cached target or AppUserModelID from the
; 2.x shortcut can survive the upgrade. [InstallDelete] runs before [Icons], so

; source for the toast attribution line, which is exactly what the rename fixes.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 3.0.0 upgrade pruning — the python UI stack and the modules that served it.
;
; The upgrade strategy is "overwrite in place" (see InitializeSetup): [Files]
; only ever ADDS, so everything an older payload laid down and this one no
; longer ships simply stays on disk forever. On a machine upgraded from 2.x
; that is ~13 MB of Tcl/Tk, tkinter, customtkinter and friends, plus the deleted
; agent modules and their bytecode — code nothing imports, that a fleet-wide
; vulnerability scan still has to account for, and that makes the installed tree
; disagree with the shipped one.
;
; Every path below is provably an orphan: none of them exists in
; build\installer_package after a clean full build (the Tcl/Tk copy step and the
; GUI requirements were both removed in 3.0.0). [InstallDelete] runs BEFORE the
; file copy, so even if a future payload reintroduced one it would be laid back
; down a moment later — this can strip a file out of an install but never out of
; a release.
;
; Nothing here touches user data: config\, logs\, cache\, tmp\ and .tokens.enc
; are never named. Nor is
; python\Lib\site-packages\claude_agent_sdk\_bundled\claude.exe — the 242 MB CLI
; that build_installer_full.bat strips from the payload but which survives on
; machines that installed it earlier, where Cortex uses it in place of
; downloading its own copy.

; Tcl/Tk runtime. The 2.x build copied these in from the system Python 3.11 so
; tkinter would have a toolkit; the 3.11.8 embeddable zip we ship contains none
; of them.

; NSSM. 3.0.0 hosts the service in tools\owlette-host.exe instead (see

; leftover nssm.exe is a 2014 unmaintained service host sitting in an elevated
; directory that nothing runs and every fleet vulnerability scan still has to
; account for. [InstallDelete] runs BEFORE the file copy and the service was
; stopped in InitializeSetup, so nothing holds it open at this point.

; WinRing0. The temperature stack moved to LibreHardwareMonitor 0.9.6 + the

; registered it as kernel service R0python / R0pythonw. InitializeSetup stops
; and deletes those services before this section runs, so the files are
; deletable here (a still-loaded driver image would survive until the next
; boot — sc delete marks it for deletion). WinTmp itself is pruned so an
; upgraded machine can never re-extract the driver; pythonnet/clr_loader STAY
; (the HardwareMonitor replacement needs them), as does the wmi package (a
; direct dependency of hardware_profile/shared_utils, now pinned explicitly).

; Prune the whole of site-packages before the copy. [Files] uses
; `ignoreversion recursesubdirs`, which OVERLAYS and never deletes, so every
; upgrade used to leave the previous release's packages behind alongside the
; new ones. It went unnoticed for as long as dependency versions never moved.
; The 3.3.4 upgrade moved three of them and left 519 orphaned files / 252 MB on
; an upgraded machine, two of which were not merely untidy:
;
;   - `claude_agent_sdk/_bundled/claude.exe` (241.5 MB) came BACK. The build
;     strips it behind a verify-and-fail guard precisely so the installer stays
;     small and agents fetch a sha256-pinned CLI instead; restoring the old one
;     also hands `cortex_cli_fetch._unverified_fallback()` a STALE CLI whenever
;     the pin cannot be read — the exact SDK/CLI mismatch the pin exists to stop.
;   - a full ghost copy of `mcp` 1.x (58 modules, all of `mcp/server/fastmcp/**`
;     and `mcp/client/stdio/`) sat importable beside 2.2.0.
;
; Safe to wipe wholesale: site-packages is installer-owned end to end. Nothing
; pip-installs at runtime, the Claude CLI cache lives in
; {commonappdata}\Owlette\cache\claude-cli, and config/tokens are elsewhere
; again. This section runs BEFORE [Files] and after InitializeSetup stopped the
; service, so nothing holds these open. This line makes the two WinTmp entries
; above redundant — they are kept only because they carry the WinRing0
; retraction rationale, which is still the reason that package must never come
; back. The python.sys / pythonw.sys entries are NOT redundant: those sit in
; {app}\python\ itself, outside site-packages.

[Icons]
; Start Menu shortcuts. Exactly ONE Start-menu entry registers the
; AppUserModelID — and every shortcut that does is named "Owlette".
;
; Windows needs *a* Start-menu shortcut carrying the id or it drops every toast
; the unpackaged desktop app raises (see the MyAppUserModelID note above), but it
; also draws the toast's attribution line from the NAME of whichever registered
; shortcut it resolves — and with several carrying the same id, which one it
; picks is not specified. Stamping only this entry makes the attribution read
; "Owlette" deterministically; "Owlette Configuration" needs no id of its own.
; ONE launcher, named after the product, that OPENS THE WINDOW (no arguments =
; "show me the window"; a forwarded second-instance launch without --tray
; raises the main window). The old pair — "Owlette" carrying --tray, which
; visibly does nothing when clicked, beside "Owlette Configuration" for the
; actual window — confused its first real user within a day of existing. The
; tray needs no Start-menu launcher: the service and the {userstartup} link own
; that lifecycle. Upgrades delete the retired "Owlette Configuration" lnk via
; [InstallDelete] above.

[Run]
; Step 0: RETRACT the Windows Defender exclusions previous versions added for

  // and logs. A backup/restore dance was attempted but failed due to Inno Setup event

  // The fix: just stop the service, kill processes, and let Inno Setup overwrite files.
  // Config, tokens, and logs live in subdirectories that [Files] entries don't touch,
  // so they survive naturally. install.bat (in [Run]) handles service re-registration.
